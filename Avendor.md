The paved floor cracks at seemingly random intervals leaving space for trees that melts into the building's wood itself, and the inside is dark and damp regardless of the conditions outside, with an eery mist that glows with a slight amber tone. Some birds hop from branch to branch. Visitors generally come to peacefully meditate, whether nature and darkness brings them calm or whether they are hoping to score big on their next hunt.
