The spell economy in Vostera follows specific rules, but overall, in the [[Ashir Empire]] it is quite expensive. The more permanent a certain magic is, (i.e. permanent enchantments), the more expensive it is. 

Spell scrolls follow the following formula to determine price, though to note that scrolls for spell levels above 7^th are exceedingly rare, and most offensive spells are not sold to regular customer freely, especially in the [[Ashir Empire]]. 
$$
f\left(x\right)\ =\ \ 35\ \cdot\ x^{2}\ +\ 30
