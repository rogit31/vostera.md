Vero, The Damned, is the deity of knowledge, omniscience, truth, and madness.

## Origin

---

Vero was born at the same time as [[Sola]] from [[Kaos]]. To fill the void of his fathers creation, as opposed to Sola, Vero sought the truth. In the belief of an objective truth and deeper meaning to the universe, Vero was driven mad by a search for meaning. Despite his unfathomable intelligence and depth of knowledge he could not see past his own quest and became mad. Despite this, he helped Sola in creating life on Vostera by gifting them the curse of knowledge, but hoped that through communication, speech, and myth the beings of Vostera would be able to find meaning and content in Vostera where he could not.

## Relations

---

It is said that in Vero's madness, cursed with the knowledge of the universe, he created his sons in an attempt to understand the world around him and alleviate his curse. [[Ma'at]] and his brother [[Kaira]] were born.

## Appearance

---

Vero's appearance is unsettling. His entire form is composed of writhing tendrils of darkness that constantly shift and writhe, as if searching for something to latch onto. At the center of this mass of darkness is a single, massive eyeball that seems to bore into the soul of anyone who meets his gaze. The iris of this eye is a brilliant, burning gold, and the pupil is an endless void that seems to suck in all the light around it.

His voice is a constant whisper, a maddening hiss that fills the mind of anyone who hears it. It speaks of secrets and knowledge beyond mortal comprehension, of truths that would shatter the mind of anyone who dared to glimpse them. Those who have heard Vero's voice often speak of how it haunts their dreams, filling their minds with dark whispers that they cannot escape.

## Cult

---

Vero's followers are few and far between, as most mortals are too afraid to seek him out. Those who do worship him are often scholars and researchers, driven to uncover the secrets of the universe at any cost. They believe that Vero holds the key to unlocking the secrets of the cosmos and will do anything to gain his favor.

## Philosophy

---

Vero's philosophy is one of absolute truth, and he believes that knowledge should be pursued at any cost, regardless of the consequences. He is willing to share his knowledge with those who prove themselves worthy, but his gifts often come at a terrible price. To seek Vero's knowledge is to risk madness and damnation, for the truths he holds are not meant for mortal minds to comprehend.
