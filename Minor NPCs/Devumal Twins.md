Gabriel is a rogue and Anne is a sorcerer specialized in divination. They are dressed in simple brown leathers and black textiles. They robbed the sheriff of [[Afeer]] of the [[Tripal]] stone, killed him and burned down the sheriff's office in the process. They were tasked with stealing the [[Tripal]] stone by an entity they do not know of but were promised a very substantial amount of coin for. Anne has a scar over her right eye and cheek.
