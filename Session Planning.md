## Ashir on the move
 - Vespera has sent some reconnaissance to start looking for the last book of genesis
 - They know it's in the aegurian wildlands 
 - They couldn't find it before, something changed as to scrying on the book
 - Players can see Ashirian scouts roam the sky from time to time 
 - On some rolls, they can perhaps notice the charred bodies of a gigantic wyvern, which could be caused by an ancient red dragon. They notice upon closer inspection that it is more likely its caused by mutliple smaller dragons. This is the Vespera squad rolling out. 
- They encounter them maybe in a week or so? 

# Phineas' Letter
Hi Kite! Isn't this new spell so cool? It traces the aetheric signature of someone you know, kind of like a beast would hunt with its scent of smell! Hopefully the beasts leave it alone and it does manage to get to you. I sent this to you on Monday the 23d, so let me know next time we see each other when it got to you. I still haven't figure out a name... Maybe paperwing? Windwhipser? Let me know if you have any ideas. We are currently crossing the Anathe chain, north of Fool's Gold and I am scared sis, this is not a fun place. We're close to our goal though, that weird anomaly I mentioned right on the edge of zone 3? Hopefully we won't have to cross that line to study it. Thankfully, Mazi, Robinson, and Yana are strong and can protect me. They slayed a Rathalos yesterday can you believe that? Mazi got picked up like she was nothing and got slammed into the ground like a cracking an egg, it was terrifying but she's a slippery one and managed to escape its jaws before that happened, thank the gods. I also wanted to let you know that the univeristy of Nagan let me know by telepathic means that my thesis was a green light and that they would publish it as soon as I cam back! How sweet would that be?

# Larger unanswered questions

- What do Vespera and Zeke know about Aylin's history, the old world and the current one?
- Based on what they know, what do they plan to do about it? 
- Who in general knows about the old world? 
- Who knows about Aylin's secret?
- Who knows the academy's actual goals? 

# TODO

- Go into more detail about the Aylin's children's upbringing, I think this will unlock a lot of the story paths for Zeke and Vespera. 
- Finish the playlists, add theme songs for vespera, the order, maybe some others.
- Make some weathered paper and write a letter from Meg's brother magnus
- Also, realistically over 800 years what would've the two immortal children have done.
- Rethink the pheonixgate thing. 
- Lucina's statsheet
- Vixal's statsheet
- Complete article about aether
- Mizutsune wyvern scale hit ? what did I mean by this
- Lavender

# Remember
