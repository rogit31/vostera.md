Symbols associated with the Fateweaver include weaving tools such as looms and spindles, as well as threads and cords that represent the strands of fate being woven together. The Fateweaver's followers often wear black robes or clothing adorned with these symbols, and some even dye their hair or tattoo their skins in webs to honor the deity.

In visual representations, the Fateweaver is represented as a giant spider-like creature with multiple arms that spin webs, symbolizing the threads of fate. Each thread is of a different color, representing the different paths a person's life can take. The Fateweaver's body is black and shimmering, as if made of obsidian or onyx, and its eyes are bright white, representing the moon that its lover [[Lua]] presides over. Its many legs are adorned with intricate, geometric patterns, symbolizing the complex nature of fate and the interwoven paths that all living beings follow.

## Cult
---

The cult of the fateweaver is mostly compromised of people obsessed with death and its significance. This can mean different things for different people, but many end up as workers of death, or related to it. Some are coroners, graveyard workers, others are assassins. 

The cult of Ma'at is quite a bit smaller than many others, since generally Ma'at is seen as a god in direct competition with the goals of most mortals, however he is not seen as evil, merely a messenger or carrier of what must come.

In some cases, some cults of Ma'at like to take a more prophetic approach, and attempt to read the webs of fate of other people, but it is generally understood that such a feat is only possible by the fateweaver himself, not by any mere mortal. 

Other people who come to the Fateweaver for guidance are people who may fear their own mortality, who want to connect with their loved ones who may be in Ma'at's hands already, or who seek guidance with their fate.
