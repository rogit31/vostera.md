# Things to think of

- How can we bring player ties back into the narrative? I.e,
- Hemlock's mother
- Meg's brother
- Bor's... horse?
- Sylril and Mila 

# Potential scenes

 - Hemlock hallucinates/dreams of the old world maybe?
 - Mention changes to blackguard glaive
 - Daniel's character and how he will fit within the story, who knows about that

# Larger unanswered questions

- What do Vespera and Zeke know about Aylin's history, the old world and the current one?
- Based on what they know, what do they plan to do about it? 
- Who in general knows about the old world? 
- Who knows about Aylin's secret?
- Who knows the academy's actual goals? 

# TODO
- Go into more detail about the Aylin's children's upbringing, I think this will unlock a lot of the story paths for Zeke and Vespera. 
- Also, realistically over 800 years what would've the two immortal children have done.
- Rethink the pheonixgate thing. 
- Lucius's green liquid stat sheet
- Lucina's statsheet
- Vixal's statsheet
- Complete article about aether
- Meet up with Daniel to do his character
