Fool's gold is a keep buried deep within the Anathe chain in the [[Aegurian Wildlands]]. It is an old pre-cataclysm [[Titans | titanic]] power station. However, the entrance to the power station has never been opened. Hidden deep below ruins of a town, that the only remains are vague structural indications of a time long past. Digging here often returns odd but valuable objects made of glass, steel, or other metals that might have survived for about 10.000 years or so. 

# Plot hooks
- Despite the freezing cold in the rest of the anathe chain, during sunny days, the ruins are strangely warm. The snow and ice melts in a particular circular pattern. 
- Biology here is particularly infused with [[Liselos]]
- Rivers here are greener than before
- There is a canyon in the middle of the ruins, where the biology is warmer. There is a glimmer of green at the bottom of the canyon. 
- The disposition of the ruins is odd. In the gorge itself, there is treasure, however, once you get closer to the heart of the mountain, to the glacier, there is an odd perfectly circular disposition to everything around it. 

Digging here can lead to the following:

| **12**     | You uncover a metallic, rust-covered green-ish longitudonal weapon looking like thing. It is engraved with the same script. It isn't functional.                                                                                             |

## Titancore facility

Once underground, the smell of stale air is overwhelming. Green particles float in the air and occasionally spark. The air here is aetherically supercharged. The scripture is everywhere. Player can find depending on their checks:

| **10** | A broken glass console still faintly glows with red emergency glyphs. The structure appears modular—like a **control center** designed to be _maintained_, not just built. You recognize a few of the characters everywhere, the numeral system from ancient draconic is the same. 741. |
| **13** | Faint **footprints** in the dust—not recent, but **not ancient either**. Small, booted, humanoid. Someone’s been here.                                                                                                                                                                  |

| **10** | The green floating particles are liselos dust, similar to the dust that was present on titanfall, too unstable to be used in magic directly without a converter or focus. Touching them gives a mild static shock. |

| **10** | There are depictions on the wall of a civilization long past. The tall humanoid figure is depicted in green, while other smaller figures seem to praise it, worship it. As you walk along the depiction, it depicts the smaller humanoids roping the taller one, subduing it. Then it depicts it being hidden underground, safeguarded. The crown of green energy that was present around the taller humanoid seems to disperse to the smaller humanoids as well. The green spreads and gives itself to other things, indicating that this seems like a power source of some kind. |

### The founder
The creator and the name this faculty takes after is [[Zachary Milentus]]. His face appears engraved in these hallways.
### The language
The language here is a script arabic analogue that is called Uranic. Only some of the signs present language in old draconic. 

### Floors
There are three floors, -1, -2, -3. 
#### -1 
Has mostly visitor-like things, depictions, of what's going on and a what seems like a security desk or something along the way. 
#### -2
Has offices, including Zachary's
#### -3 
leads directly to the actual entrance of the central core. 
### The door
The door to the nest of the facility is protected by a combination of symbols of this scripture they cannot read. It seems to be numeral. The password is 0211, the date of his daughter's birth, and that date can be found in Zachary's office, on the -2 floor.


## Tripal dispersion system
Tripal is required to be coupled to atually work, however, this uses different radiation lengths to do so. This titancore reactor uses a spectrum of liquid tripal to emanate a constant flow of aether to connected manufactured aether-based technologies.
