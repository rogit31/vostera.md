The One Year War is a military conflict in between the [[Ashir Empire]] and the [[Imari City States]].

## Prewar escalations

---

The Imari city states and the [[Amelian Kingdom]] formed an alliance in the year 802 AD called the [[Imari Military Alliance]], fearing an incoming invasion from the [[Ashir empire]]. The [[Ashir empire]] declared war to the IMA in 804, claiming that the accumulation of forces to the south was "worrying" to the safety of the empire. Many speculate that this invasion was mostly due to a newfound reserve of [[Liselos]] on [[Imar|Imari]] soil as well as a generally advantageous geo-political position, with the [[Ashir empire]] possibly controlling an entire section of the globe.

## Progression of war

The war was extremely swift, with the [[Ashir Empire]] deploying thousands of troops on Imari soil. The Empire's army also compromised hundreds of special arcane operators, sourced from [[Academy Arcanum]]. This raised many controversies due to the theoretically pacifist objectives of the Academy. The invasion caused tens of thousands of deaths on the Imari side, with losses counted in the thousands on the Ashir side. The sheer numbers of the [[Ashir empire]] as well as the advanced technology and spellweaving of the empire made this war very one-sided. Exactly a year after the declaration of war, the IMA abdicated.
