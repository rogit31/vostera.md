Her parents met as hunters in the Aegurian Wildlands, and then retired to a village in Eastern Aegur when they had her and her younger brother, Phineas. When she grew up she wanted to follow in her parents footsteps by making her own way in the Aegurian wildlands and has been doing so for years now.

Her brother was always the more bookish sort, and instead ended up studying magic. Their differing personalities always created same awkwardness between them, but she has always been very protective of him.

In recent years, he has occasionally joined her on hunts in the Wildlands as having a wizard around can be useful. During an exhibition that he went on without her he went missing and she has been pushing to find him since.

Other important characters in her life; Gurr/Felix - her parents (Orc mom/Tabaxi dad) are still retired in Eastern Aegur and she goes back to visit them as often as she can. Her mom is no nonsense but loving and her dad is a boisterous ex-thief with a heart of gold. 

Allyssa - (Elven healer) a member of Kite's previous adventuring party who she had a secret relationship with. They broke up because of Kite not being comfortable coming out with her sexuality putting a strain on their relationship

Kite has always been overly protective of those she cares about, for those outside of her inner circle she often has a "live and let live" attitude, not liking when people enforce their will on others. She sees her rage as a tool to be used, but also a danger to be contained. When she rages, her eyes glow a solid yellow colour and she summons spirits of her ancestors, on both sides of her ancestry, to aid her.
