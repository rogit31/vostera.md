# Announcements
# TODO

- Finish the playlists, add theme songs for Vespera, the order, maybe some others.

# Story beats

### Elwyn brings back the gang

- The gang is composed of [[Raoul Ragimund]], [[Khava Amina]], [[Magnus]], [[Jone Alberwood]] and [[John Alberwood]].
- They piece things together to formulate a plan, a counter-attack
- 


## Sylril's dream

This time, Sylril is faced with the goddess for a conversation about what it means to be champion. 
- The fateweaver will not take him
- He is made to make [[Mila#Champions|the pact]]
- Once he dies that is all
- He is given the pheonix's tooth

## Hemlock's vision

### Vespera's Meeting

To set up the whole episode, could have a moment where he peers through the eyes of a shapeshifted truthseeker, who then gets caught
Out of this meeting, he gets: 
- A new timeline (a month?) for the teleportation machine to be built
- And the invasion to commence

### Vespera's Coup

She invades the church of [[Vero]], in order to kill [[Edward Buldany]], and round up the rest of the church of Vero. The symbol of the tri tree appears again.


## The choice

With the rest of the gang, the NPCs indicate that the best moment to strike is when the invasion itself commences. Before then, they have a month to prepare. They can either

- Get stronger materially, by diving in to a dungeon hunting for relics
- Get stronger intellectually, by finding out more about the world at Titanfall
- Get stronger socially, by making friends in the right places and doing politics

The choices have variables amounts of purely combat encounters but will lead the story. Or a secret fourth option if they have it. 

## Some kind of combat

I feel like I need to include a little bit of combat at the very least, even if it's short lived, just because Daniel is here. Idk maybe I can ask him. 

## Kite's letter
A letter to kite from her ex mayhaps!


## Character Moments
### Hemlock
Don't know what to do with his mother
### Kite

### Sylril

### Meg
Literally have no clue besides Magnus


## Empire POV

Vespera knows the tome of civilization is there and in the hands of the dragonrider (most likely her brother)
- She sends academy troops to look for it. 
- They presumably don't know anything else about it. 
- Some academy troops were previously sent to deal with Phineas and his research. 
- They tracked and found the party, had a fight with them, which would have ended in an at least partial academy victory since Phineas's party didn't come back. 
- When they fought, they left behind traces of a fight. Phineas' party fought valiantly, but lost eventually. Uuno interrupts, killing the peacekeepers and kidnapping Phineas' party. He currently inhabits Phineas's body.

# Remember
- Highlight the interactibles (3 things)
- Use music and ambience 
- Embody the character

# When in doubt

## Player ties
- Hemlock's mother
- Meg's brother
- Borse comes back one day
- Sylril and Mila 

## Larger unanswered questions

- What do Vespera and Zeke know about Aylin's history, the old world and the current one?
- Based on what they know, what do they plan to do about it? 
- Who in general knows about the old world? 
- Who knows about Aylin's secret?
- Who knows the academy's actual goals? 

# Previously

## The combat continues

- Retreat, speech
- Remember to accentuate mila's thing
- Johnny arrives
- The combat continues while the rest explore

## Hemlock's dream

Hemlock dreams about [[The Planewalker|Aylin Ashir]] and [[Roshan Hunfrid]] as a continuation of his previous dream.
- Expose the Titan Power Plant in the Aegurian Wildlands  (they would call it something else)
- Roshan and Aylin argue about whether or not he should publish his results. 
- Roshan thinks that people deserve to know the Titans are conscious, sentient and capable of pain.
- Aylin thinks he should make the selfish choice, for the sake of their safety.
