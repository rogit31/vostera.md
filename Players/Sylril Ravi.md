## Backstory

As per Tristan's writing: 

1. Church of Sola at Tepurg extremely pacifist, when orcs raided my village my brave, strong sister stepped up to fight, a Sola cleric in their pacifist ways cast hold person onto my sister to prevent further bloodshed, I watched as my sister got carried away by the orcs
2. I come to hate the inaction and cowardice of the church of sola, and come to hate the use of magic
3. i eventually end up in the main church, the night before the adventurers arrive I get a vision from mila to commit to action, its now or never, and it compleled me to help the adventurers break into the church
4. now, syril is a person distrustful of anyone who would wait for justice, who hesitates when facing clear crossroads, and magic in general. He himself casts magic as a means to an end
