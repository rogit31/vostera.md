# Creation Myth 

In the beginning, there was [[Kaos|Kaos, the Godfather]], the sole entity to exist in the vast universe. The god of time, eternity, the cosmos, and existence itself, Kaos populated the cosmos with his sons and daughters, the stars. Among them, [[Sola]] and [[Vero]].  Sola, feeling the weight of solitude in the vast expanse, birthed the planets, and among them, Vostera.

## Titanic Age
---
[[Sola]] lovingly bathed Vostera in her radiant light, and from the primordial glow emerged the [[Titans]],  colossal beings of aether, nature, and light. With each step they took, mountains rose, canyons formed, oceans swelled, and volcanoes erupted, shaping the very landscape of Vostera. Yet, for all their grandeur, the [[Titans]] were bereft of consciousness, speech, emotion, or the ability to reproduce. Their singular purpose was to bask in the radiance of Sola's light, and in their mindlessness, they engaged in endless battles over Sola's light, sparking The Titanic Wars.

## Titanic Wars
---
For centuries, these Titan clashes raged on. Every conflict devastating enough to demolish mountains or empty an ocean. The discord among Sola's creations saddened her deeply, witnessing the mindless battles fought over her precious gift of light. Filled with disappointment, anger, and frustration, Sola withdrew, entering a state of dormancy known as [[The Thousand Year Winter]]. During this time, all [[Titans]] perished, unable to survive without their life-giving connection to Sola's light.

## Planewalker's Age
---
Upon awakening from her slumber, [[Sola]], in her wisdom and compassion, decided to grant life on Vostera a second chance. The era of The [[Titanic Wars ]]came to an end, making way for a new age, the contemporary era of Vostera. Sola, with the aid of her brother Vero, bestowed additional gifts upon her creations. She granted them the capacity for speech, conscious thought, empathy, and the ability to love one another, hoping they would embrace her gift in harmony.

From the diverse environments of Vostera arose distinct humanoid races. The woods gave birth to the elves, the mountains to the dwarves, the plains to the humans, the jungles to the orcs, the tundra to the halflings, the desert to the dragonborn, and the beaches to the tieflings, among others. When Sola's light connected with the body of a dormant Titan however, a special kind of being emerged, [[The Planewalker]].

She guided the first civilizations and settlements along, and her long and prosperous life was dedicated to teaching the art of spellweaving to those gifted with the same arcane abilities. Revered as the original and first spellweaver, it is believed that all spellweavers are the descendants of [[the Planewalker]], carrying her legacy throughout the ages.

# History of Vostera

## The Age of Titans
---
In the ancient past, Vostera was a world dominated by the [[Titans]], colossal beings of aetheric minerals, nature, and light. These majestic creatures roamed the land, shaping it with their immense power. They were not fully conscious beings but possessed an instinctive desire to absorb the radiant light of [[Sola]], The Sunmother. The [[Titans]]' movements caused great awe and sometimes fear among the humanoid inhabitants, who revered them as living embodiments of cosmic forces. Life on Vostera flourished in harmony with the [[Titans]], and the people had no need for gods or deities.

## Technological Advancement
---
As time passed, Vostera's humanoid civilizations developed impressive technological advancements. Harnessing the abundant magical energy emanating from the [[Titans]], they created machines, devices, and spells that greatly improved their quality of life. [[Titans]] were revered as a source of limitless power, and there was no need to rely on prayers or divine intervention when the people could wield aether and magic themselves.

## The Captivity of Titans
---
The thirst for power and technological progress eventually led to a desire to control and harness the [[Titans]]' energy on a grander scale. Several capital cities sought to capture and immobilize the primordial [[Titans]], which had natural weaknesses that could be exploited. Political entities around Vostera captured and subdued the [[Titans]] to serve their own self-interests, powering cities, machines and weapons.

## Discovery and Betrayal
---
As the [[Titans]] were subdued, a dark secret was unveiled by [[Roshan Hunfrid]], a researcher on titan biology. He made a ground-breaking discovery that the [[Titans]] were not as mindless as humanoids around Vostera thought, but being capable of feeling pain, pleasure, resentment and desire. The public perception of the [[Titans]]' capture and captivity relied heavily on the accepted belief that they were mindless beings, as they were previously widely admired and revered. His research threatened to destabilize the [[Titans]]' captivity, which in turn would cause great trouble to countries around Vostera. He was pressured to keep his findings secret, and was ultimately murdered and his research destroyed.

## Aylin Ashir's Revelation
---
His wife, [[The Planewalker|Aylin Ashir]], a researcher in [[Aetherology]], was devastated by her husband's death. They had argued for months over whether or not he should push for his research to be published. 

>  "Roshan, this isn't for us to push. It's not safe. Just this morning I saw them! In front of our doorstep hiding behind the $@%#! I know you care a lot about this, but could you keep it hidden? For now at least?"
>  
>  "Why should we hide from the truth? Is this not what we became academics for? The people. The [[titans]]. They deserve to know. I won't stay quiet."

She delved deeper into her research and eventually stumbled upon the potential to create a powerful anti-magic bomb using refined [[aetherates]], the material derived from the [[Titans]]. Horrified by the exploitation of the [[Titans]] and the sheer greed of Vosterians for aether, Aylin resolved that the only solution was to start anew. Without aether.

## The Cataclysm - Titanfall
---
Aylin kidnapped several children of different species from different nurseries and retreated to a pocket plane. There, she detonated the devastating anti-magic bomb she had crafted, now known as Titanfall. A complex aetheric device, that gradually siphoned, amplified, and reflected Aether within itself, embedded in the body of a [[Tripal]] titan. She levitated the titan above the largest city on Vostera, before plane-shifting to her bubble and let the titan fall. The impact of Titanfall rendered magic unusable all over Vostera, plunging the world into darkness and chaos. The ensuing shockwave devastated the continent of Eloran, causing massive wildfires and ejecting debris into the atmosphere, leading to a nuclear winter that killed off much of the remaining life on Vostera. The only remaining living beings were [[The Planewalker|Aylin]], her two blood children [[Zeke Ashir]] and [[Nola Ashir]], her approximately 20 adopted children, and the rare druid or wizard who happened to be in another plane at the time of impact. 

## The Aftermath
---
Approximately a thousand years later, Aylin and her kidnapped children emerged from the alternate plane. Time passed differently on the plane, and a year there was about a thousand on Vostera. The survivors, now faced with the bleak reality of being some the only living beings on Vostera, formed a small village at the center of the now slowly healed Eloran continent. Aylin was happy as she came back to Vostera. She tried casting a spell, it failed. Aether was gone. And with it the greed of the Vosterians, she hoped. 

## Aylin's Failure
---
For decades, Aylin raised her children by herself. It was hard work, but as a scientist she believed in herself and the soil around her to sustain them. She had kept some tools and books that she used to make the process easier. Her children grew along with the soil around them. Eventually some of them split off, explored the territories next to hers. Some of her children fell in love and had children of their own. "Roshan would've been proud." she thought to herself. None of them knew. About the [[titans]], about the greed, the bomb. She explained their existence with a convenient myth, some gods, a nice story about forgiveness and love. Some of them started worshipping her characters, which she thought is odd, she never thought of herself as much of a fictional writer, but she didn't mind. Anything to keep them from ever discovering the poison that is aether. As she grew older, her family grew and her settlement now had a name, [[Avendor]]. As she slowly started to feel the life drain from her body, in a state of semi-consciousness, she felt it. Like a shimmering star in a sea of ivory black, like a spark in a moonless night, a tingle in the back of her neck, the pumping of an evil putrid heart, the web that bound life together, aether. She flicked her fingers together and whispered the words for ignite. She felt the aetheric flame curl up her fingers. It was back. 

A terrifying realisation came over [[The Planewalker|Aylin]]. Much as a roach that couldn't be squashed, aether never died. It was subdued, erased, but it was slowly coming back. How fast would it take to come back to pre-titanfall levels? Decades? Millennia? It had already been about 1000 years, so at this rate a few millennia was probably close she guessed. How did it fail? If her theory was right, a bomb like the one she made should've wiped it for good. Her mind raced with questions and doubts, anxieties and fears. Try again? Build another bomb? She didn't have time. Decades of research and materials accumulated were destroyed. How could she protect her children from the slowly creeping aether? How did it fail. Why did it fail. She didn't have time. Maybe this time it'll go better. She'll teach them how to use it. Maybe it can be used for good. They needed to be taught. To be led. To be controlled. She started writing furiously. Everything she knew. Medicine, agriculture, politics, philosophy, mathematics, chemistry, aether, physics, war. She'll give it to [[Nola Ashir|Nola]]. She was always calm and in control, responsible and a natural born leader. If she failed to erase it, maybe she could control it. Aether, like a wild beast could maybe be tamed if given the proper direction. [[The Books of Genesis]] were born from her writing. They enabled [[Nola Ashir|Nola]] to accelerate the progress of the Ashir valley civilization by tenfold, with modern knowledge and technology already at her fingertips. Aylin taught her daughter the secrets of the aether too. Her first spell, her first enchantment. She told her to protect the weak from it, and to cull the powerful and greedy. Finishing her books and entrusting the future of Vostera in her daughter, [[The Planewalker|Aylin]] passed away. The [[Academy Arcanum]] was born short after. 

## The Veil of Ignorance
---
For centuries, Vostera remained enveloped in the veil of ignorance. The survivors of Titanfall, along with the descendants of Aylin, spread across the continents, adhering to the revised history and beliefs. The old world and its secrets were buried deep within the confines of Aylin's legacy, ensuring that the cataclysmic event of Titanfall would be forgotten, and the true nature of the [[Titans]] would remain a mystery. [[The Planewalker]]'s revelation was lost to time, as the people of Vostera embraced their new understanding of history and the world they inhabited.
