Kimbar is nicknamed the Iron Long of [[Eloran]] because of it is situated in between two of the most productive mines in the whole [[Ashir Empire]]. 

## Historical background

Kimbar used to be hub of commerce for agriculture in the [[Ashir Valley]], with farmers, traders, artisans and merchants alike would meet to trade and sell goods before they followed one of the most famous roads in the empire, the blue valley road. This road goes from [[Natalor]] to [[Port Dalia]] through [[Avendor]], following the rushing waters of the [[Atergan river]]. In the last 50 or so years though, Kimbar has gone through radical changes as the [[Ashir empire]] drastically changed its focus to exploiting the natural minerals of the surrounding mountain ranges, resulting in the accelerated development of [[Eloran]] and [[Onen mines]]. These two mines focus on Silver and Iron ore respectfully, and return most of their raw ore straight to Kimbar via horse drawn carriages and caravans. Kimbar has become the place where all this raw ore is processed, resulting in massive economic and demographic growth, but also covering the city in soot and grime. The nickname the Iron Lung came not too long after that.
