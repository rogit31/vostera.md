LiselosÂ is a material that is found mostly in the continent of Imar. It usually presents itself as a small green shard of hard gem-like material. Its most important property is its capacity to store energy. It is currently used by the [[Ashir empire]] to fuel lamps, and in human experimentation by [[Academy Arcanum|the academy]]. It is suspected the invasion of Imar was mostly done in an effort to capture its reserves of Liselos.
