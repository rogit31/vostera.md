# Potential scenes

 - Information gathering, explaining the game, encountering a significant other party
 - Pepper story and rp moments throughout the travelling somehow
 - They're looking for a red dragon, so make it a chase for the adult red dragon somehow

## The red dragon
- On some rolls, they can perhaps notice the charred bodies of a gigantic wyvern, which could be caused by an ancient red dragon. They notice upon closer inspection that it is more likely its caused by mutliple smaller dragons. This is the Vespera squad rolling out. 
- They encounter them maybe in a week or so? 


# Larger unanswered questions

- What do Vespera and Zeke know about Aylin's history, the old world and the current one?
- Based on what they know, what do they plan to do about it? 
- Who in general knows about the old world? 
- Who knows about Aylin's secret?
- Who knows the academy's actual goals? 

# TODO


- Go into more detail about the Aylin's children's upbringing, I think this will unlock a lot of the story paths for Zeke and Vespera. 
- Finish the playlists, add theme songs for vespera, the order, maybe some others.
- Make some weathered paper and write a letter from Meg's brother magnus
- Buy a better marker and try map-fuing 
- Also, realistically over 800 years what would've the two immortal children have done.
- Rethink the pheonixgate thing. 
- Lucina's statsheet
- Vixal's statsheet
- Complete article about aether
- Wyvern goop
- MIzutsune blow dart
- Mizutsune wyvern scale hit

# Remember
- Highlight the interactibles (3 things)
