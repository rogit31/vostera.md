# Potential scenes

 - Hemlock hallucinates/dreams of the old world 
 - Information gathering, explaining the game, encountering a significant other party
 - Pepper story and rp moments throughout the travelling somehow
 - They're looking for a red dragon, so make it a chase for the adult red dragon somehow

## Ashir on the move
 - Vespera has sent some reconnaissance to start looking for the last book of genesis
 - They know it's in the aegurian wildlands 
 - They couldn't find it before, something changed as to scrying on the book
 - Players can see Ashirian scouts roam the sky from time to time 
 - On some rolls, they can perhaps notice the charred bodies of a gigantic wyvern, which could be caused by an ancient red dragon. They notice upon closer inspection that it is more likely its caused by mutliple smaller dragons. This is the Vespera squad rolling out. 
- They encounter them maybe in a week or so? 

### Vespera's trick
She messages Meg pretending to be Magnus. She asks them where they are so he can send her a letter. 

# The chase
the group encounters the day after they rest, the remains, bones, clothes and property of what looks like to a similar squadron of peacekeepers. They find a sending stone. Later into the day, "Sergeant Greywood reporting, we've found signs of a red dragon spotting at fool's gold, i repeat, sighted at fools gold. *SCREAMS* crashing, roar."  the sending stone reports to all squads to abandon wyverns as it poses too much of a danger to travel in the air because of the dense concentration of monsters. We got a report of a Red Dragon Spotting They claim to be 4 days out from reaching fools fold. 

## Empire POV
Vespera knows the tome of civilization is there and in the hands of the dragonrider (most likely her brother)
- She sends academy troops to look for it. 
- They presumably don't know anything else about it. 
- Some academy troops were previously sent to deal with Phineas and his research. 
- They tracked and found the party, had a fight with them, which would have ended in an at least partial academy victory since Phineas's party didn't come back. 
- When they fought, they left behind traces of a fight. Phineas' party fought valiantly, but lost eventually. Uuno interrupts, killing the peacekeepers and kidnapping Phineas' party. He currently inhabits Phineas's body.




# Larger unanswered questions

- What do Vespera and Zeke know about Aylin's history, the old world and the current one?
- Based on what they know, what do they plan to do about it? 
- Who in general knows about the old world? 
- Who knows about Aylin's secret?
- Who knows the academy's actual goals? 

# TODO

- Build the old world, what it was like and what traces are left
- What did Phineas find about the old world?
- Why did Phineas disappear? Is he the only disappearance or did his entire crew disappear? 
- What is in Fool's gold? 
- What is the actual adventure or structure of this session? 5 stage 'dungeon' perhaps? 
- Who is the dragonrider? 
- How are the Peacekeepers planning on finding the dragonrider, the book, and what did they do with Phineas if they were the ones to kidnap him? 
- How do we deal with random encounters and resting from now on? 
- How do I make it into a chase in between the peacekeepers and the party?
- Go into more detail about the Aylin's children's upbringing, I think this will unlock a lot of the story paths for Zeke and Vespera. 
- Finish the playlists, add theme songs for vespera, the order, maybe some others.
- Make some weathered paper and write a letter from Meg's brother magnus
- Also, realistically over 800 years what would've the two immortal children have done.
- Rethink the pheonixgate thing. 
- Lucina's statsheet
- Vixal's statsheet
- Complete article about aether
- Lavender
- Banbaro Battle horn
- They rolled a 15 on the die
