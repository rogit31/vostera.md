The Soft Spot is the name given to The [[Underbelly]]'s HQ. It used to reside in the north pole, only accessible through magical means. It has since been destroyed by [[Vespera Argent]] as retaliation for the [[Underbelly]]'s incompetence (and as a direct result of [[Cheetoh's Angels]] actions) because of their failure to deliver the [[Tripal]] stone that was in the underbelly's possession to [[Alexander Hasan]].
