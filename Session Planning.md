## Hemlock's dream 
 - EYE
 - Flapping of flags, dry cold imari wind. The sound of a leather tent opening and closing. 
 - A familiar elven face with gray hair walks through 
 - There's a silence as the other sergeants in the tent cut the small talk
 - 
"Imari forces have started digging into their trenches and reinforced their position over the hilly southern side of Ardora's Tower. Their height advantage proximity to fort goria has made it difficult for us to advance any further into their territory without losing a significant amount of men. "

# Larger unanswered questions

- What do Vespera and Zeke know about Aylin's history, the old world and the current one?
- Based on what they know, what do they plan to do about it? 
- Who in general knows about the old world? 
- Who knows about Aylin's secret?
- Who knows the academy's actual goals? 

# TODO

- ring of elemental resistance
- Bitey companion page
- Green dragon sac powder
- Go into more detail about the Aylin's children's upbringing, I think this will unlock a lot of the story paths for Zeke and Vespera. 
- Finish the playlists, add theme songs for vespera, the order, maybe some others.
- Make some weathered paper and write a letter from Meg's brother magnus
- Buy a better marker and try map-fuing 
- Also, realistically over 800 years what would've the two immortal children have done.
- Rethink the pheonixgate thing. 
- Lucina's statsheet
- Vixal's statsheet
- Complete article about aether
- Green goblin waiting for them at the Last Respite, multicolor armor, metal opening/voice 

# Remember
- Highlight the interactibles (3 things)
- Use music and ambience 
- Embody the character
