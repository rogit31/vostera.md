# TODO

- Finish the playlists, add theme songs for Vespera, the order, maybe some others.
- Determine the loot that they found, including the x amount of scrolls, the necklace kite stole, and a variety of baubbles that Hemlock stole as well. 

# Story beats

## Hemlock's dream

Hemlock dreams about [[The Planewalker|Aylin Ashir]] and [[Roshan Hunfrid]] as a continuation of his previous dream.
- Expose the Titan Power Plant in the Aegurian Wildlands  (they would call it something else)
- Roshan and Aylin argue about whether or not he should publish his results. 
- Roshan thinks that people deserve to know the Titans are conscious, sentient and capable of pain.
- Aylin thinks he should make the selfish choice, for the sake of their safety. 

## Sylril's dream

The goal is to give Sylril a very explicit way of progressing an internal conflict with Mila. 
Maybe I just once again very explicitely shove him to think about his character's motivations. 
Perhaps even better would be to put him in a situation where his moral compass is tested in battle. Mila believes above all in courage and unyielding determination even in the face of overwhelming odds. So put him in a situation where he needs to chose in between losing surrendering something previous or himself and overwhelming odds of defeat and reward him for that choice. 

## Kite's letter
A letter to kite from her ex mayhaps!

## Character Moments
### Hemlock
Don't know what to do with his mother
### Kite

### Sylril

### Meg
Literally have no clue besides Magnus


## Empire POV
Vespera knows the tome of civilization is there and in the hands of the dragonrider (most likely her brother)
- She sends academy troops to look for it. 
- They presumably don't know anything else about it. 
- Some academy troops were previously sent to deal with Phineas and his research. 
- They tracked and found the party, had a fight with them, which would have ended in an at least partial academy victory since Phineas's party didn't come back. 
- When they fought, they left behind traces of a fight. Phineas' party fought valiantly, but lost eventually. Uuno interrupts, killing the peacekeepers and kidnapping Phineas' party. He currently inhabits Phineas's body.

# Remember
- Highlight the interactibles (3 things)
- Use music and ambience 
- Embody the character

# When in doubt

## Player ties
- Hemlock's mother
- Meg's brother
- Borse comes back one day
- Sylril and Mila 

## Larger unanswered questions

- What do Vespera and Zeke know about Aylin's history, the old world and the current one?
- Based on what they know, what do they plan to do about it? 
- Who in general knows about the old world? 
- Who knows about Aylin's secret?
- Who knows the academy's actual goals?
