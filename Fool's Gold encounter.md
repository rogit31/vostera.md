This encounter has the following NPCs:
- Vixal Blund, leader of squad 1,
- Colt Caldwell, leader of squad 2 and an advanced sorcerer
- Emias Paine, leader of squad 3, and an advanced warlock-style
- Edith Whiterock, leader of squad 4, and cleric-style
- Each squad has one sorcerer and one paladin each as well
- One Protective rock golem
Except it is immune to fire damage, provides half cover to anyone behind him, and it is not invulnerable to the physical stuff. It also doesn't have its slow ability.
