The Amelian Liberation Front (ALF) is a resistance group that operates in the [[Imar|Imari]] continent of [[Vostera]]. Led by [[Alexander Hasan]], a former military commander of the now-defunct[[Amelian Kingdom]], the ALF seeks to overthrow the rule of the [[Ashir Empire]] in [[Imar]] and restore the [[Amelian Kingdom]] to its former glory. The ALF was formed following the one year war between the[[ Amelian Kingdom]] and the [[Ashir Empire]], which resulted in the defeat of the [[Amelian Kingdom]] and its dissolution.

The ALF is composed of a diverse group of individuals, including former soldiers of the [[Amelian Kingdom]], Imari nationalists, and mages who possess knowledge of arcane materials such as Liselos. The ALF operates in secrecy and conducts guerilla warfare against the [[Ashir Empire]], sabotaging their operations and attacking their soldiers whenever possible.

Despite being labeled as terrorists by the [[Ashir Empire]], the ALF has gained support among the Imari people who are dissatisfied with the current regime. The ALF's ultimate goal is to create an independent Imari state that is free from the oppression of the [[Ashir Empire]] and governed by Imarians themselves.
