Title: Adenville
---

Adenville, otherwise known as the city of ash is the fifth most populous city in the [[Ashir Empire]]. Nestled against the shores of the [[Mosilian Ocean]], this thriving metropolis is enveloped by the embrace of the Arian Woods, a thick forest of coniferous trees around the city.

## Geography
---
Adenville's strategic location on the west coast makes it a bustling maritime hub, serving as the main trading post to the western continents of [[Taldatrica]] and [[Aegur]]. The [[Mosilian Ocean]] also makes for a scenic backdrop for the city, which makes it a popular tourist destination. To the east, the [[Arian Woods]] stand as a natural border, fencing off the city and providing most of the city's lumber.

## History
---
The legend says [[The Planewalker]] herself founded this city centuries ago, and was her place of retirement. Since then the original house is still preserved and kept as a tourist attraction, though locals doubt to its authenticity. It is said she died of old age before being moved to the Sundown Monastery. Since then the city has steadily grown as a maritime hub and popular tourist destination.

## Demographics
---
Adenville is composed mostly of humans, with a higher than usual population of elves and dwarves for the [[Ashir empire]]. The town also has a very significant amount of students, and has the second largest student body behind [[Avendor]].

## Local Government
---
The mayor is a half elven woman named [[Liren Voltsan]]. The local council is a relatively well balanced mix of merchants, woodworkers, professors, clergy, working class citizens and students.

## Architecture
---
Adenville's architecture has an interesting mix of Ashirian, elven, and dwarven influences that combine into a specific architectural style that feels intricate and maximalist in its design. The surrounding Arian woods provide for most of the construction material and as such all of the residential buildings are wooden, made of walnut and oak wood, giving buildings a dark color that many choose to keep in the original color and grain. The streets are paved, if a bit dirty at times. The inner circle of the city has the privilege and the money to afford to import stone from the slightly further stone fields of [[Titanfall]], and is constructed mostly with the signature ashened gray-ish almost volcanic looking rock. This has given Adenville the nickname of the city of ash.

## Economy
---
As a major port city, Adenville's economy thrives on maritime trade, with ships arriving from distant lands laden with exotic goods. The port of Adenville is chock-full with markets and stalls selling and trading the goods imported from the West to Ashirians. As an export, the [[Arian Woods]] contribute valuable resources, including rare herbs and an abundant amount of oak and walnut wood.

## Culture
---
Adenville's cultural tapestry is woven with threads of imperial tradition and the influence of western dwarven and elven cultures. The Adenville Academy being one of the largest in the Empire and thus across [[Vostera]], there are many foreign students that come to Adenville with the hopes of making it as an [[Academy Arcanum|Academy]] graduate. The city features a significant divide in between its main social classes, the blue collar workers (made mostly of woodworkers), the academics, and the merchants, who stand at odds to gain control over the local government. Despite this, the city has a unique unity due to its relative isolation to other cities, cultural diversity, young population, and academic qualifications that make it one of the safest and serene cities in the [[Ashir Empire]].
