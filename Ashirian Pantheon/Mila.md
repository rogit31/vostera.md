Mila is the daughter of [[Ma'at]] and [[Lua]]. She is the goddess of love, war, blood, fire, sex, murder, passion, consumption and incineration. 

## Philosophy
---

Mila's philosophy is one of passion, desire, and strength of character. She believes that what gives life its meaning is the courage and determination to stand your ground in the face of overwhelming odds. This can be within multiple contexts, but it is generally best understood under the context of war or ideology. As such, prominent figures in Mila's church, generally known as Mila's champions, are often war heroes, (most often of the [[Ashir Empire]]) or political or scientific figures who overcame the status quo through sheer grit. 

This is often also with the connotation of passion to the point of combustion. Mila believes that believing in something so deeply that it consumes you, from the inside and out like a fire would, whether it be a lover, a cause, or an idea, is the greatest achievement one can have. That is generally what is understood as the everblazing heart when it comes to Mila's followers. 

> "A soldier's greatest weapon is not his sword, but his unwavering, everblazing heart."

It is believed that in between both of her parents, life and death, Mila is the one to give meaning to life. Both as a child, and as a goddess. 

When the faithful go to war, they pray to Mila, so that they can give them the strength they need to fight for their loved ones. When the faithful look for their reason to exist in Vostera, they pray to Mila, so that they may have the strength and courage to seek out the passion they desire. And when the war ends, and the battlefield goes silent, the survivors pray to Mila, to give them the compassion and strength to forgive their enemies.

## Symbolism
---

Mila is represented in art as a tall armored woman with the hair of her grandmother, red fiery crimson. She is often seen holding a waraxe. She is usually represented with her left breast carved from her chest, revealing a constantly bleeding heart, pouring boiling, dark crimson blood. It is said that despite her unceasing hemorrhage, the eternal flame that lives within her gives her the courage, vitality and power to move forward and stay on her two feet. 


## Champions
---

Champions of Mila are special entities that represent Mila's will on Vostera. They are exceptionally skilled servants of the eternal flame, and while they technically have a will of their own, Mila takes only the most devout soldiers under consideration. To be considered for championship, one must kill and consume the heart of another of Mila's chosen, most often denoted by an affinity for small quantities of fire, generally sparking from the tip of the ear. One must then discuss with Mila and pronounce the following pact: 

 > Carnal body's sweet liquor
 > Vein's water and wine
 > To the eternal flame divine
 > I cede the flaming ichor
 > Of mine
