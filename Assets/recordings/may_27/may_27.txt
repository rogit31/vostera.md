[Speaker 1]
Well, it's more like, I mean, we know the charcoal doesn't charge. I just wanted to. I mean, I think it would be interesting to see it walk around.

[Speaker 2]
I'm honestly bound. Yeah,

[Speaker 1]
Cuz it's not like we need this facility, and we don't want other people being able to use this energy. I think

[Speaker 2]
I think the the implications, because if if gobbledum can get it to work, a little of Aspera can definitely get it to work a lot, and if she can just have like these guns being charged up to the maximum all the time, just being sent wirelessly from this guy that sounds. So, I think we can. I'm I'm good for freeing the Titan. Destroying the cylinder and looting the triple.

[Speaker 3]
Sure.

[Speaker 1]
I guess the only can the only setback or concern is that? Is it easy to catch this guy once he gets out because

[Speaker 4]
You know, he's just a little. He's a little sunflower.

[Speaker 1]
It feels like he he would be easier to take advantage of if I was going to swear a in his current state like, you can just show up, plug your stuff in, and go, whereas at least if he's walking around. It's a little harder.

[Speaker 2]
I think we should freedom.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, yeah.

[Speaker 2]
Let's do it okay.

[Speaker 5]
Okay. Um. How do you plan on doing that?

[Speaker 1]
It's just taking the plugs out of them.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, we, we don't know. So, it's the ripping the ripping the IV out of your arm.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, you can. You can absolutely do that, um. It takes a long time, uh, it will take you the rest of the night effectively. Uh, these are extremely heavy objects. I mean, one of these cables is effectively the size of one of you. And it takes like a lot of effort from, uh, both kind of the more like physical, uh, physically apt people amongst a group, and the more magically apt, uh, to kind of help everything go along smoothly. But eventually, you do manage to pull kind of these cables, and as you pull them out from this Titan's body, you see that they are very similar in construction to the needles that are going into your arms. When you use these guns.

[Speaker 5]
They have like this kind of, like silver, pointed tip, uh, that pierces Titan's body. But you pull them out. Um, and eventually, I mean, this thing is, like, no longer being used for its energy. Um, it's still trapped here underground. But it is no longer powering this place as soon as the guys pull these blocks. Whoever is in the control room would hear much warnings. You know, all the signs of, like something catastrophic happening. But you managed to like free him at least of? Being. Used for its power.

[Speaker 1]
How deep is he in the hole too many feet?

[Speaker 5]
A lot. Um, the the feet of this Titan this Title itself is maybe, you know, as tall as like? Um, I think like a hundred ish meters or so, whoa! Um, on

[Speaker 1]
Top of his head. To the top of the wall,

[Speaker 5]
Oh u. Admit, not that though, maybe like a 20 meters or so.

[Speaker 2]
You can jump out of here.

[Speaker 5]
Uh, but the Titan itself is very, very tall. You

[Speaker 2]
Say he's 100 meters tall? Yeah, he's

[Speaker 5]
Gigantic.

[Speaker 3]
I guess, yeah, he's

[Speaker 2]
Okay. I was just like. Not imagining this hole correctly, then it's a hundred meters on the ground. That is intense. Yeah,

[Speaker 1]
It's

[Speaker 2]
More like monkey leader, you survive, survive falling down this

[Speaker 5]
Hole, right? Oh, he only survived falling down the first 20 meters. Yeah, yeah, oh

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, right?

[Speaker 2]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
I guess we can figure out how to get them out next time.

[Speaker 2]
So, the next the Titans now, like, free from all these cables, but it's not responding. It's not moving.

[Speaker 5]
Um, no, it's effectively not moving. I mean, okay, there's a few things one, uh, it's night time now, um? So, to some extent, it is sleeping at this point. Um and number two. Whether it's the way that like this whole is constructed, you can see, like the physical construction of this place, was made to restrain it. It is like the exact size of like the the dimensions of the Titan made in a way that it cannot move.

[Speaker 2]
Um.

[Speaker 5]
This whole place was made to detain him. Um. Yeah.

[Speaker 2]
All right. Yeah, I'm sure

[Speaker 1]
It would survive if we pull up everything else. Well, yeah, right?

[Speaker 2]
Took it as a attack.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah,

[Speaker 3]
Probably don't want to anger it.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah,

[Speaker 1]
We're gonna experience out here. I hope it came.

[Speaker 2]
Okay. It's my time we go. We gotta go see

[Speaker 1]
Some Uno. Take a nap.

[Speaker 3]
You go rest,

[Speaker 5]
Um? You. It is a. By the way, as you come back, uh, Uno greets you and goes. Well, any, uh, interesting observations that you've made.

[Speaker 3]
Don't tell them anything. We should discussed beforehand that we're not going to earn anything.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, yeah. Wait, really. We're not going to tell no anything.

[Speaker 5]
I mean, he, it's like, right there.

[Speaker 2]
He, he recommended against it. If he didn't say, don't do it, I would be mad. If you do it, he just said, that's a bad idea.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, let's just see how

[Speaker 3]
I don't trust him.

[Speaker 2]
We aren't trusted, not trust me. Okay. You can probably find out this guy can't lie. I just won't say anything.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah,

[Speaker 5]
I'm just.

[Speaker 2]
All right, all right.

[Speaker 5]
Anything interesting that you found?

[Speaker 3]
Uh, found this cool rock. And I hold up a rock.

[Speaker 5]
That's fantastic. You've really found nothing else. I mean, like, do you guys hide like the weapons?

[Speaker 2]
It's a great place.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, I'm not sure. Guys now, we're gonna hide those.

[Speaker 5]
You guys, you can hide them if you want.

[Speaker 2]
We can confess to that. We don't have to say we know what it is. We just say we found shiny stuff. Yeah, they found

[Speaker 3]
These fun! These cool looking things! Oh,

[Speaker 2]
That's fantastic! From the shini stick, I like it a lot. I got a new shirt.

[Speaker 5]
Shirt.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, I put on the the next.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, yes, can, can I take a look?

[Speaker 3]
Maybe when you live up to your end of the deal, we'll let you look at our cool stuff. Never consider

[Speaker 2]
That.

[Speaker 5]
So I will. Looks interesting, though in a few days.

[Speaker 2]
I gotta just sneak it back into my backpack. Mostly quite today, aren't we? We are. You have anything to hide?

[Speaker 5]
We

[Speaker 3]
All have something to hide.

[Speaker 2]
Also like what I just put in my backpack? I am hiding that from you.

[Speaker 5]
Well, yes, I, I've. Where she

[Speaker 2]
Gets her brother back, okay?

[Speaker 5]
Do you guys think that I want this? This body dude!

[Speaker 3]
I think that you said we would bring you a magic user and then you would get out of the body and that you have not done what you said you would do.

[Speaker 5]
Well, I'm doing this for your own sake. We all agreed to wait until she told us about zika, she and the Order of the black son.

[Speaker 3]
Person that's against us that was trying to kill us that I captured well,

[Speaker 5]
Forgive me food being egotistical person. But if you had to. For example, choose a hair that you could be reborn into, and you had the choice in between. Dung beetle and lion, which one would you prefer?

[Speaker 3]
I am a lion, exactly.

[Speaker 5]
You choose the lion. I'm waiting for the lion. So we can? Does that make sense?

[Speaker 1]
Like, kill. Well,

[Speaker 5]
Yes, we will have to kill her so I can inhabit. This does. Does she know this this? No, we're, you're having this conversation in the park,

[Speaker 2]
Right? Yeah, probably bled

[Speaker 1]
With you're. You're? Line, like when we were gonna let we want to take over our body, like when she surrender, and we brought that up a lot, but we were talking in front of her, I

[Speaker 2]
Guess. Did we?

[Speaker 5]
Uh, she doesn't know it. Yeah. Anyways, point being. I'm hoping tomorrow, maybe? Um, I understand you have your secrets. You can keep them.

[Speaker 5]
I'll see you tomorrow. Uh, and she kind of. Heads off towards his own, like little corner of a cave. He doesn't seem to asleep, uh, at least. Yet, like she's just like he has like some kind of book or something, and he's scribbling in

[Speaker 2]
It,

[Speaker 5]
But he's keeping to himself. Um. And that's I'm sorry. What are you

[Speaker 3]
Writing in the book?

[Speaker 5]
Aren't you curious? I have my secrets too.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah.

[Speaker 2]
He just chuckles, he laughs.

[Speaker 5]
He's he's the comedy unit.

[Speaker 2]
These minis didn't want to tell me,

[Speaker 3]
Dear diary, I went to school, was so mean today.

[Speaker 5]
Everyone takes a long rest. Uh, is there anything that you guys want to do during the night, or you know before this conversation comes to be?

[Speaker 2]
This, this? What? Sorry,

[Speaker 5]
The conversation that you're gonna have with with this

[Speaker 2]
With secretary?

[Speaker 1]
Well, can Meg wait for him to fall asleep and then try to read his book?

[Speaker 3]
I was about to say the same thing.

[Speaker 5]
Um, he does not sleep. He just straight up stays awake the entire time.

[Speaker 2]
Whoa, whoa. That's Reiki. That's kind of weird. That is Major freak Vibes.

[Speaker 1]
I was dying. He's, like, I don't sleep. I don't eat, like,

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, that cannot be. They're still like he's still inhabiting, like bodies of normal, regular, relatively normal dudes, right?

[Speaker 3]
Are you calling my brother relatively normal?

[Speaker 2]
Compared to him, right. This guy, like his body's so sleep, deprived. He's hot sleeping. But did you want to do something? Robin,

[Speaker 1]
Um, I just want to read his book. Okay, is he, is he working on book the whole night, or is he? Does anyone take a break to stare off?

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, yeah. There's some points where he kind of just takes a break. He takes a walk around, you see, at one point he, like, walks off to kind of the edge of like this Cavern. Down to where barramund is, then it comes back up. He sits there. He seems to be having a conversation with his Dragon, uh, telepathically, while he's sitting there. Whoa, whoa.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, uh, the bag is going to post up. Beside they're, like, you know, in an eye, what's it called, like being able to see him when he goes for his break to go chat with her when she's gonna try to sneak out and read the book.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, make, uh, make a stealth check. Stuff and then slight friend.

[Speaker 1]
May 14, still, he's

[Speaker 5]
In 14 stealth. As soon as you start, like approaching, kind of like his corner. Um, he. Looks towards you and you immediately hear his voice go. I wouldn't touch that if I were you. He noticed you,

[Speaker 2]
You got clocked?

[Speaker 1]
I'm gonna Meg's gonna walk forward towards the book anyways, and I'm gonna try to just. Like a child rushed to it and try to grab it as fast as I can to read it.

[Speaker 5]
Five.

[Speaker 2]
Uh, your health, uh, he

[Speaker 5]
Casts the whole person on you, I believe. Oh, sorry, that's a wisdom saving throw. You can remake it strong.

[Speaker 5]
Four

[Speaker 1]
Seven. Oh

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, you're held. There's just like this blast of energy that goes towards you, and you maybe like you freeze in your tracks. Goes towards you. He kind of has like his hands behind his back. He goes, you know, you could have just asked. It's nothing that important, really? Um, I did ask. Well, I would rather you ask than steal it. Can we

[Speaker 2]
Walk up and like? We're gonna help Meg out of the whole person, right?

[Speaker 5]
If you want.

[Speaker 2]
I'm not like, I'm asking.

[Speaker 5]
Like all of you are awake, uh? I mean, some of you are sleeping, I don't know, whichever do all of you wish to wake up and intervene,

[Speaker 2]
Uh, there's one thing that I wanted to do as well. That's right, so obviously.

[Speaker 5]
Um, he goes. I understand tensions are. Um, I would appreciate it if you didn't sneak up on, you know, my things? I didn't pry into yours, so maybe? About distance like that? Uh, as like, you guys all wake up and start to like position around Meg, uh, bear mode flies towards the entrance of the cavern and is looking into it.

[Speaker 2]
Apologies. We can all just.

[Speaker 1]
I

[Speaker 5]
Mean, he is still concentrating on this problem.

[Speaker 2]
Guy, just like you can, like, help somebody out of it physically, right? I

[Speaker 5]
Don't think so, but as soon as like, he, you go towards her, he dispels, then they're going to spell. It's a story, and he kind of like opens up the book, and he shows it towards you. Um, it is written old draconic, but. It's a story, uh, you see, like that. There is a story of, like, uh, some kind of character. It's like a boring, fictional story.

[Speaker 1]
It's boring,

[Speaker 2]
It seems boring to you.

[Speaker 5]
Well.

[Speaker 1]
I

[Speaker 5]
Don't know. Let's see, you're

[Speaker 2]
Thinking of publishing.

[Speaker 5]
It's decent. Uh, it's something about, you know, uh, and like, anthropomorphized, uh,

[Speaker 6]
Vegetable. That is, like, yeah.

[Speaker 5]
It's Mighty fails. He's the author of vegetables.

[Speaker 3]
Oh no, why does all your stories have such a Christian Edge to them?

[Speaker 2]
Christ.

[Speaker 5]
I'm not sure what that is, but um, I would appreciate it if everyone kept the bearings and didn't. Provoke each other, and you know, impede on each other's privacy. And it's a small cramped space, but I appreciate that.

[Speaker 1]
Take it as a compliment. I did it because I thought you'd be writing something more important.

[Speaker 2]
Damn

[Speaker 1]
Sorry! That's really

[Speaker 2]
That was so!

[Speaker 5]
I have been at the. Waking Edge of this world, and you know, trying to plan on how to?

[Speaker 5]
Have a Bastion of last defense against. And effectively. A woman who thinks that it is? God's given power to inherit the world and control all of the magic that is in it. I like stories. Um, and if you do not like them, then I guess. That is your choice to make.

[Speaker 1]
I'm sorry.

[Speaker 5]
Let's go back to sleep, shall we? Um. Just kind of like an awkward silence and coldness in the air now. But. Just put it away.

[Speaker 2]
There's one thing that I wanted to do.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah,

[Speaker 2]
Can I wake doorble them up? Yeah. Um. They double, though chill, chill, chill. We're okay.

[Speaker 3]
Do you remember anything right?

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, it's supposedly, uh, I, I had him his, his little hook. You just read.

[Speaker 1]
Yes,

[Speaker 2]
Yes, okay, okay? Um. It's so adorable though. Do you remember, um? Did he read the book of civilization, or was it just me?

[Speaker 5]
No, he read it, but you were counting on him forgetting.

[Speaker 2]
Right and then? I guess I don't remember,

[Speaker 5]
You don't remember it either. Do

[Speaker 2]
I remember the fact that I read it, or do I not?

[Speaker 5]
You remember the fact that you read it? You don't remember the concept. Okay,

[Speaker 2]
Adorable them, so I've been thinking about this whole book of civilization thing. Where, um, and? And I was thinking about what what Uno said about how knowing? What's in the book makes us a Target?

[Speaker 2]
And how we wanted to both get the knowledge and not get the knowledge at the same time. Yes. Um. So, have you heard of a thing called a thieves can't? Um, can I explain it to him? So, like I, I? These scandas, kind of like a like a, it's like a code message. And it's like, like, an encryption for thieves, right, okay, um? And what I was thinking is we could write a unique thieves can't? And then use it to translate the book of civilization. And then we'll have the code, and then we memory wipe.

[Speaker 2]
Ourselves. And so we have the translation in the code. And we have the code and the two things are separate, but we don't have the book anymore. Okay, but So, where is the code? And where is the translation? Are you? How is this going

[Speaker 5]
To

[Speaker 2]
Work? Couldn't see just torture us and get both.

[Speaker 5]
No, but nobody will know that. The

[Speaker 2]
The translation exists. Nobody will know that there is a code for it. It will be a one-on-one type of thing. And if we upload upload? Well, I guess what's called if? If I use Vero's Vision on it, oh yes, nobody will be able to find it because this is not Vero's book. This is a translation of Vero's book or a coded various form. Always exist, but it won't be able to be translated by anyone who. Doesn't know what they're looking at. Does that make sense? That makes sense. Shall we give it a try?

[Speaker 5]
Sorry, I'm confused.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, I. I was thinking about this, right? Yeah, so what

[Speaker 5]
I want

[Speaker 2]
To do is basically come up with a way to like using, like thieveskin or whatever, to basically encrypt. Um, this the book of civilization into this other language, right? And then, I read the book of civilization, and I'm translating it at the same time, and every time I translate it, I memory white. And then I start from the next thing,

[Speaker 5]
And neither of

[Speaker 2]
Us. Remember the code until we re-read it? So, by the time we finish, we'll have a fully encrypted thing,

[Speaker 5]
So you you have the the Book of Genesis, uh, and then you have a cipher, and then you have a translation,

[Speaker 2]
Right? Um,

[Speaker 5]
So you're reading the the book, you're translating it, and then you're wiping your memory of the book, right?

[Speaker 2]
Yes, and the cipher.

[Speaker 5]
Just be a jumble of code. Yes, okay.

[Speaker 2]
But there'll be a copy of it all, right?

[Speaker 5]
Uh, a couple

[Speaker 2]
Of considerations. How? How many pages is this book? It's long,

[Speaker 5]
Uh, it's long, thick, and big. Is yeah, a solid like 200 pages or something, like just the just the

[Speaker 2]
Consideration. Like, how long does it take to just transcribe a book, let alone transcribe it, while also encrypting it. That's what I was thinking about, and you can only do that. Um, let me just for like 30 minutes, right? It was. 20 minutes per use of modify memory. And let me just check, uh, what log of Harmony is?

[Speaker 2]
Modify memory is.

[Speaker 2]
No, it's 10 minutes, so it's 10 minutes. It uses a fifth level spell slot, so. Per day. We can only do 30 minutes of translating, translating. Okay, thanks. And that would, for that whole day, you would use both level five spell soft plus my level six, plus one.

[Speaker 3]
So I mean?

[Speaker 2]
We'd be a prologue that we only do 30 minutes per day, maybe a week. Well, maybe. I guess we don't have to do this idea. I was just kind of thinking out loud. It

[Speaker 5]
Was really important,

[Speaker 1]
But yeah,

[Speaker 2]
I was thinking, maybe we can do, like, let's page or two, let's find the important? If we can find the important bit about the bomb and then just do that one, I think that's doable.

[Speaker 1]
In civilization. That would be

[Speaker 5]
The tone of War. Yeah.

[Speaker 2]
Right? And, but also, the the Toma civilization, the whole we were thinking of the whole thing, was, like, oh, this is, like, good stuff. We don't know which. Yeah, last we we were doing something where you and me were sitting down, reading the home civilization, trying to figure out what was important to, right? Yeah, I guess we could keep doing that for tonight. Yeah, the one. So, for? I do still have two fit level spots left remaining for the next, so for, like, we'll do that for 20 minutes and just try and investigate the book. And then, yeah.

[Speaker 5]
Yep, uh, you do so, u? And yeah, probably making an investigation check.

[Speaker 2]
He's all better 15, 15, 10,

[Speaker 5]
10. Um. You keep reading the book, uh, it's hard to like, pick up where you left off, because a lot of the context that you had, you know, is wiped. You do make some progress. Um, you find the page that is specifically talking about means of teleportation. And it effectively says that, uh, teleportation is one of like the most, uh, prized spells. Uh, as like a concept because of how powerful it is to disseminate, uh, things troops information. Also one of the most. Energy inefficient spells. It takes a very large amount of energy to transport a person, especially from one place to another, especially over long distances.

[Speaker 5]
You see that there as like, your time is starting to run out. There seems to be a solution to this problem. And the solution is the fact that the machine that is going to be proposed in, like the next few pages. You start reading and you start like scanning through it, trying to figure out like what exactly it is and how it works. It is effectively. A permanent, uh, teleportation Circle in the way that, like, a teleportation Circle spell that you understand is. Um. But it is powered by. In this book, it seems to specify some.

[Speaker 5]
Unknown. A source of energy that you very quickly come to realize is most likely the same exact thing that you guys just inspected. Okay, so we definitely should build this thing up.

[Speaker 2]
I guess, yeah. Okay. Okay, wipe your. I'll wipe your memory, and we probably. Go to sleep, but what do I write in my journal to like,

[Speaker 1]
I could write down the page that it was on?

[Speaker 2]
Oh yeah, yeah, write down the page number, and then I also write down. Uh, like, destroy, like, we gotta. We gotta get rid of that that, um, cylinder of triple.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, we already heard us, yeah. Well, we just unplugged it. Yeah,

[Speaker 5]
Yes, yeah. I will say you are not entirely sure if it met specifically this source of energy or another. It is like an unnamed source of energy. You come to the conclusion that it's either this or something similar. Don't know if, like, specifically this place.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, I'll just do

[Speaker 5]
That. Um. Okay. The rest of the night goes without a shoe. You guys all have, you know? The kind of things that you're thinking about, um, that you're hoping for the next day comes, um. And. Edith, who was tied up in like a part of the cave. Uno kind of like picks her up, uh, and drags her to the front of the cave. Ungags. And goes. Well is, uh, the leader way to join us. And Edith, kind of like. She gets like the thing, uh, the gag, like pulled out of her mouth. Um, she coughs a little bit.

[Speaker 5]
Can

[Speaker 7]
I get some some water? He produced

[Speaker 5]
Like some water with the spell, pours it into a glass, and like hands into her. She drinks some water. She goes. He will be with us soon. Not in in person, obviously, but um.

[Speaker 5]
You'll hear him. Soon. Uh, and after a few minutes. All of you hear a voice in your head? That goes.

[Speaker 5]
Welcome! I've heard of you all.

[Speaker 5]
Let's start with introductions. What are your names?

[Speaker 5]
I'm

[Speaker 2]
Hemlock.

[Speaker 5]
It's a very weird feeling to be thinking this information. But you feel that it is, uh, being corresponded.

[Speaker 1]
Hi, Meg.

[Speaker 2]
And doorbellum sees that everyone is is responding to is, oh, you guys hear that, too.

[Speaker 5]
My name is Uno. Um. It's fucking Discord Channel Jesus Christ. He goes. His name is Pluto. No, no, he's. Yeah, uh, he goes.

[Speaker 5]
My name is Zeke, and I appreciate all of you being here today. I've heard of you from. Well. Some of you are here with, uh, Lucina, I believe old traveling companions of hers. I do appreciate, um.

[Speaker 5]
Bringing to us. Oh, less happy about the outcome of. Lucius. Well.

[Speaker 5]
Let's start with the basics. What are your goals? What do you wish to achieve?

[Speaker 1]
Stop, save people.

[Speaker 2]
Yes, I guess that is on there. Of Gilbert Sparrow.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, yeah.

[Speaker 2]
Stop the Hungarian Invasion.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah. Number one, oh.

[Speaker 2]
Return the body of the flame rocker.

[Speaker 1]
Hmm.

[Speaker 5]
I was wondering who was at the origin of the? The secretion of the Tomb of my mother.

[Speaker 5]
Depending on us. I'm glad to know that it's. Indeed, not one of us.

[Speaker 5]
Some of our goals do align, and I'm glad to see that.

[Speaker 5]
We are aiming for. Stopping the Sparrow by any means necessary. Including, of course, about it. And.

[Speaker 5]
Preventing the invasion of ego as a noble mission not? That we. Highly opinionated about, but wish to stop, but nonetheless. Let me get straight to the point. We do not believe that. Is possible without the use of. A weapon, the weapon that we now possess. The plans for, and have a great idea of? How to make? We would appreciate your help and would be totally grateful if you were to give any information that you have about. The old world, the nature of the Titans, the power that. Shared amongst some of these machines. And. If you could?

[Speaker 5]
The information that you have from Titanfall? Um, we know that you have visited the research facilities there. Our operatives did not make it out alive.

[Speaker 5]
If you can share any information, then we would be grateful.

[Speaker 5]
Are you willing to is my question?

[Speaker 2]
Information as a price.

[Speaker 2]
Price.

[Speaker 5]
We are willing to pay.

[Speaker 5]
We are willing to cooperate with you when it comes to. Stopping for spare up and?

[Speaker 5]
Going past our previous history. And providing you with means of.

[Speaker 5]
Well, stopping whatever it may be. Troops, monetary resources. Knowledge, whatever it is you seek.

[Speaker 1]
I don't

[Speaker 2]
Think.

[Speaker 2]
Confident in making and disclosing. Um. The information. Currently.

[Speaker 2]
Especially regarding what we saw at Tyson fall.

[Speaker 3]
And.

[Speaker 2]
The means of? What was he saying the the old world or whatever?

[Speaker 3]
I

[Speaker 2]
Do have a question. Yeah, uh, can you remind me what the, uh, the the black sun lady needed no, for

[Speaker 5]
She seemed to mention that, uh, Uno's help in specifically Gathering, uh, etherits was kind of what she was looking for,

[Speaker 2]
So they need to eat darts in order to make the bomb that would get rid of all the the all the what the either yeah.

[Speaker 5]
Um. You see him, you do like a bead of sweat, kind of like form on his brow. He goes. It's been a while now since we've talked brother.

[Speaker 5]
Actually, you've been keeping yourself busy. How did you? Survive. Um.

[Speaker 5]
He goes.

[Speaker 5]
It's been a long time.

[Speaker 5]
It's not as much survival as it is. Um, bring Foundation, perhaps?

[Speaker 5]
I'm sure you are no. I'm sure you've found some way of doing that as well, since you're still here. Um. There is like a very short exchange, um. Uno asked another question that he ignores him. Um. He goes. What exactly is? The plan for you to stop the Sparrow? Is it outright combat?

[Speaker 5]
Yes.

[Speaker 2]
Are going to kill her.

[Speaker 5]
And you believe yourself strong enough for this?

[Speaker 1]
We'll figure something out that isn't blowing up everybody. Yeah.

[Speaker 2]
We're currently exploring alternatives to your method.

[Speaker 5]
To be clear. Once again, it is not about blowing up everybody so.

[Speaker 2]
Are we talking to Obama right now?

[Speaker 2]
Let me be clear. Pretty good.

[Speaker 5]
You're

[Speaker 2]
Broken!

[Speaker 2]
We will bomb

[Speaker 5]
Iraq, uh, no.

[Speaker 2]
After we kill West Barrel, we got him. Ladies and gentlemen,

[Speaker 5]
Uh, no, he goes. It is not about. We're blowing up everybody. It is about putting. I'm not staring at inhabitants on a level playing field. Like I said about Yemen, yeah.

[Speaker 2]
Yes, I. I've actually been interested in that. In the pursuit of an organization, I want to ask you, what do you make of? The increasing number of of people capable of casting magic it. It's been clearly shown that the number of individuals capable of catching magic is growing, uh, and it doesn't seem like it's stopping. Rather, it seems like the rate, the, the proportion of the population that can cast spells, is increasing at at a faster Pace than ever.

[Speaker 2]
This. Do you know?

[Speaker 5]
We've observed a similar effect across. Bostera and? The amount of spellcasters has increased undeniably, and the amount of ether generally around each one is. Also, undeniably increasing. We all unsure as to what the origin of it is and? We are extremely concerned that with the way that the spread of ether is going. The goal of the academy is to control the flow of ether and to withhold. As. Of. Positive power on the people around it as physically possible in order to extend its own influence and power. And monopolize the good uses of ether and suppress it with the bad uses of ether.

[Speaker 5]
My point is the growth of ether is not. A good thing. Unfortunately, despite the fact that? Who knows? In 100 years, 200 years, maybe everyone will be able to cast a spell.

[Speaker 5]
We think that the academy will still find a way to monopolize it.

[Speaker 2]
Well, wouldn't your fight be with the source of this imbalance that you seek to? This map will be the academy rather than the existence of ether itself.

[Speaker 5]
That is why? We want to stop for Sparrow first. And then. We'll address the. Fundamental. Inequalities in this world.

[Speaker 2]
But I would like to suggest you. But in the near future, when everybody perhaps is a magic cashback. What did this inequality and imbalance that you speak of? Be disappeared. We said we're going to equilibrium where everybody would have the power, and so nobody would be at a disadvantage.

[Speaker 5]
My brother once told me a tale that I found.

[Speaker 5]
Quite frankly, very boring. She talked about how? There is a cycle to things. Things that repeat themselves across history across time. And that?

[Speaker 5]
The point was to stop. This certain cycle of violence? Your grandfather kills. Someone's cousin. It's a generational Feud, people killing each other for centuries. The point is. She told of a time where magic was so abundant that Titans existed, walked around the earth, roamed. The fields, the oceans, and the mountains of vostera. And despite the fact that they were effectively devoid of human emotions, they still. Murdered each other. Thought over the light. And eventually brought their own Doom. Do you think that? The people on this Earth are capable of handling. Spells of a nature, such as Fireball at the age of 8 years old.

[Speaker 2]
I would say no. That we agree.

[Speaker 1]
But that's why the academy could be so useful at school. It's teaching kids how to safely deal with these things that are happening. What if the problem is that the longer you're alive, the more you abuse magic because it kind of seems like the most powerful people hear? Live a lot longer than us. Maybe you're the problem?

[Speaker 5]
You're not incorrect. However, there's a again natural imbalance in between the people that populate the South. Some of us naturally live longer than each other, some indefinitely so.

[Speaker 1]
Maybe we should introduce a cap?

[Speaker 5]
Maybe you should tell yourself?

[Speaker 1]
I mean, I, I know, it sounds ridiculous, but it, it's kind of just as evil and ridiculous as your own plan sounds. There's a lot of harm in order to create some good.

[Speaker 2]
And we're forgetting about. All of the people that will suffer in the hell that will be Unleashed as soon as ether is gone. And this power vacuum. A lot of people will suffer.

[Speaker 5]
You're afraid to hold whatever beliefs you wish. We strongly believe that the lesser of. The three evils is a world without ether. It's not a. With the academy and majors and sorcerers. We believe the academy is inherently evil. That control over a resource that is fundamentally dangerous. Is not possible, especially once it becomes available to the hands of children and whatever. Peasant wants to cast a spell can effectively rupture the Earth in half.

[Speaker 5]
We are unsure of the future. We do not know it raises his head.

[Speaker 2]
He keeps talking,

[Speaker 5]
Uh, yeah.

[Speaker 5]
We believe this is the Lesser evil. We are free to choose differently if you wish, but for now, our objectives do align somewhat. You wish to stop the spell we wish to do so as well.

[Speaker 2]
Don't ask the question. Um, what have you just blew up half of the ether?

[Speaker 2]
Just snap your fingers

[Speaker 3]
And populate.

[Speaker 5]
I do not think that is a possibility, um.

[Speaker 2]
Like, enough magic, wouldn't you say that the world in which there is just enough magic to fuel the very convenient spells, but not enough to harm people Fireball after the question, but great water is a very useful Stone, among many others. Empowers conveniences or daily lives,

[Speaker 1]
Healing words, Healing word,

[Speaker 2]
All of these good stuff.

[Speaker 2]
There you hear a

[Speaker 5]
Sigh through. Uh, he goes.

[Speaker 5]
I am very aware of the fact that there are many positive and practical applications. To ether, including healing? Uh, water, fruits, whatever it may.

[Speaker 5]
Despite this. There is still much evil in the world and.

[Speaker 8]
Aren't you guys like doing some of that?

[Speaker 5]
Yes.

[Speaker 2]
I just think the plan is too extreme, but. Here goes me saying that to an extremist.

[Speaker 5]
He goes.

[Speaker 5]
Again. The ethics of moral quadaries of our mission.

[Speaker 2]
Hours, and you are free to disagree.

[Speaker 8]
Right,

[Speaker 2]
But we disagree. We disagree. Well, how about this? Let us try killing Respero without using your bomb. We fail or die, and you can use your bomb. I'm sure you guys are strong enough to take a run after her magic is gone. But we will not be helping you with your. Your bomb? But we just ask that you don't

[Speaker 1]
Blow

[Speaker 2]
Up The Ether before we take on Vespero. If we're dead, we don't care what you do. Uno

[Speaker 5]
What do you?

[Speaker 2]
We used to go.

[Speaker 5]
I have always been on board with the idea of. At least trying to stop the spell first.

[Speaker 5]
Again, I, I do see some truth to what my brother has to say. I am not. I know ironic of me to say, so I'm very Adept at it and care about it a lot, but I do think that there is. Some things about this life. That would be simpler without ether. Um, but I would like to try first with. Um. I'm sorry, brother. Yeah, I disagree with you once more. Um. He goes. Very well.

[Speaker 5]
You have?

[Speaker 5]
I mean, I wish you luck. Um. How much time do you think you need? Could

[Speaker 2]
We get back to you? We have 20 how many rifles? 24. If we want them all to be charred with.

[Speaker 5]
You won't care about it

[Speaker 3]
Whether we succeed or fail

[Speaker 2]
When we attack. It'll take

[Speaker 3]
At that

[Speaker 2]
Point at all with fifth and six level spell slots.

[Speaker 5]
This is our times that sort of matter for us as well.

[Speaker 2]
Well, I mean, we know that you are not ready.

[Speaker 5]
I mean. You have?

[Speaker 5]
Well, since we're not getting your help, we'll take a little longer. Three months. Should it be enough if you're as strong as you say, you are? I'm sure. But eventually. I, I do have one question what will happen to

[Speaker 2]
You and your siblings supposedly mortality after you blow up all the ether?

[Speaker 5]
Well. My immortality. And I've been asking to pick up Chapter check.

[Speaker 2]
Perception. Yeah, I can't see it.

[Speaker 1]
Nice, um.

[Speaker 2]
15, 15. Um, as he says this,

[Speaker 5]
You get like. A memory. Someone else's memory just pops into your brain.

[Speaker 5]
You did not even necessarily ask for this memory, uh, but it comes to you as a vision almost as a Deja vu kind of thing. Where, like,

[Speaker 2]
Oh, I remember

[Speaker 5]
This? There's like this. You see a? A. A platform.

[Speaker 5]
Almost like an offering of some kind, uh, and around it. These, like? Of hordes of of people wearing these black robes with this kind of Insignia on their back of the order of the black Sun and in the middle. There's this, like? It's a mountain of like flesh and veins, uh, and hair, and like this amalgamation of like different creatures that is just like, constantly pulsing, like just one giant heart, uh. And that image just flashes into your body for, like, a second, uh?

[Speaker 5]
My mortality is not. Guaranteed without Etho? Asparagus is, it's a biological fact she is enough, and she will live for as long as her body. Wishes. Bulldogs. Well, I'm not sure what his methods are. Uh, and he goes. I mean, the body that I would be in would survive until it dies of natural causes. But if there's truly no ether left, I cannot cast a spell, but It's been a long life.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, buddy, you're not dying just yet.

[Speaker 5]
I would hope not. I have to finish my book.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, Larry, the Cucumber do next.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, what's crazy? Is that girl? Suggestion is actually the that's the bomb is to put a cap on their lifespan.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah. That's its own ethical problem. To be like, sorry, you pay 500.

[Speaker 2]
You gotta add out man. Could I start trying to sketch what I saw? Yeah, absolutely.

[Speaker 5]
He goes. Might as well try three months. And then. Well, hopefully we'll be done with our. Plan B. But they succeeds, then we'll see what happens then. Best of luck! And you feel that this, like? Correction is effectively term.

[Speaker 5]
Well, that was, uh, an interesting conversation. Oh, you see, like, uh, he is sweaty, um?

[Speaker 2]
You okay, boys can't sweat.

[Speaker 3]
He's half.

[Speaker 5]
Have

[Speaker 2]
To

[Speaker 5]
Backseat and half work

[Speaker 2]
Orchestra would probably sweat. It sounds disgusting. He just had, like wet fur.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, it's pretty gross. That's pretty gross. Well, isn't there, like patches of fur, and then like patches of skin or sulfur. Oh, it's straight up all fruit, okay, sweat, so I can't sweat, um.

[Speaker 2]
The hairs are, like, yeah,

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, yeah. He wouldn't be sweating if he weren't in Phineas's body. It's

[Speaker 3]
Like when something is bloodied, but it doesn't have blood. It's the same situation. Yes,

[Speaker 5]
Yeah. Um, he's internally sweating. You're okay! It's. Particularly a conversation to have with my brother, who I thought was long dead. What's what's why are you so nervous? You don't

[Speaker 2]
Seem relieved to see him alive. You seem rather.

[Speaker 5]
I. His demeanor is not the same as what it was when he was alive. It feels. How different and I mean? Zeke was a very intelligent man and very.

[Speaker 5]
Willing to converse and and exchange his ideas and? Um. This is just not necessarily feel like the zika I give, um. Different in what way?

[Speaker 5]
I don't think he was telling the truth. I think he was like. You don't think it's Zeke really? I don't know if it's not Zeke, or if it's not. Um. Actual intent. I don't know. I, I just don't believe that seek would do this. And maybe it's just my, you know, my previous affection for my lost brother? But

[Speaker 2]
Something about it just doesn't seem right. I think he's lying too. I'm

[Speaker 5]
Glad to hear that someone else has shares my opinion. Are not crazy, but about everything. He's

[Speaker 2]
Talking about everything, or, or specifically, what does he lie about.

[Speaker 5]
He's a goal. Is it just? I mean, as you said, if he wanted the quality, we could wait.

[Speaker 5]
Maybe it's something different, I, I don't know, but? This bomb.

[Speaker 5]
I was on at first. I was considering it, but now, uh, hearing my brother talk about it, it doesn't feel like. Something about it just doesn't fit, right?

[Speaker 2]
Should we kill him or just to be safe? Zeke, yeah.

[Speaker 5]
I mean, how would you even kill him? I don't even know where he is. I mean, I

[Speaker 3]
Think we already have one ancient child of God. We have to kill her. Now, let's not add more to our list.

[Speaker 2]
I'm sixties and killing Whisvera. He's a whale.

[Speaker 2]
No, you. That was good. I, I, we, you, you're quite a nice fellow you. I don't think you have, but we won't be going after this,

[Speaker 5]
So I'm just I'm not next on the list. Yeah,

[Speaker 2]
We're just good because it's all of all of, you know, visperia's siblings, you know, the the children? Are you

[Speaker 5]
Heroes all hit midnights, really? They're just, I'm just saying this. It's not a pattern, right?

[Speaker 5]
Is the interwisdom. Yes, I've heard it as well.

[Speaker 2]
You're big, sarcastic, no? Anyways, you know, just as a death shit, you know, if he's really, I don't know if he's gone mad?

[Speaker 9]
If he's not the brother he wants, knew?

[Speaker 2]
We, killing him is an option.

[Speaker 1]
It will say from our experience with the black Sun. A lot of the things they've been doing, put a lot of people at risk and hurt people kind of thoughtlessly. Like, my spirit hires like smart people, and he hires like dumb people. And so, when he's like, go do something, we've just seen them kill a lot goons.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah,

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, goons.

[Speaker 5]
Generally, terrorists aren't the smartest.

[Speaker 3]
Like, we were saying this.

[Speaker 5]
Anyways, we can proceed to the main event, uh, there's gas to spell and kills her.

[Speaker 2]
Just like that, she said

[Speaker 1]
Goodbye or something. Why, which

[Speaker 9]
Is? Which is a terrorist.

[Speaker 2]
She's just a

[Speaker 3]
Dude.

[Speaker 5]
She's just a good.

[Speaker 1]
You elves would look a lot better. He started really reflecting on how mortality actually matters to more people. I'm well, my original

[Speaker 5]
Body is not enough. I was both.

[Speaker 3]
Original body. This is only the first time

[Speaker 1]
We brought it to work.

[Speaker 5]
Yes, that's correct. This is the first time I ever actually had to cast this boat.

[Speaker 2]
What was your mom?

[Speaker 5]
I'm sorry. What

[Speaker 1]
Was your mom, your dad?

[Speaker 5]
It was a plane Walker,

[Speaker 1]
But she was in a dwarf.

[Speaker 2]
It was an accurate conception.

[Speaker 1]
He has a dad.

[Speaker 5]
No, I. But what up me and my siblings are not biologically related?

[Speaker 1]
When your mom is not a dwarf? So, your dad on the door?

[Speaker 5]
Yes, well, listen. If you are to believe the stories of the world, we were just born from different places, um, from, you know, the Sun and the power of the sun looks like a Titan, but more realistically, we're probably just adopted.

[Speaker 3]
If you were to believe the story of the world you were there, what do you mean if you were to believe the stories of the world. Yeah,

[Speaker 5]
That's. That's exactly my point. We know how this happened. It's not, and if I can tell you exactly what my recollection was. Go ahead. I teamed Consciousness as a child of many, including my sister, my brother Zeke, uh, we were about maybe 25 to 30 children, um. All had a singular mother being. The plane Walker herself,

[Speaker 2]
But no dad.

[Speaker 5]
No father in sight.

[Speaker 1]
Was she nice to you?

[Speaker 5]
My mother was. Nice is a complicated thing when you have 30 children.

[Speaker 2]
So she's gonna adopted mother.

[Speaker 5]
Most likely. Yes, she is my adoptive mother. I do not particularly believe the stories that she told us about where we came from.

[Speaker 1]
Um.

[Speaker 5]
You know, some of the children did for the entire life spans, but I think the majority of us once we hit, you know, a certain age. We started realizing that the reality might have been different.

[Speaker 2]
What story did you tell you about about where you came from?

[Speaker 5]
She told us that we were. Actually, the story of the Titans and how they fought each other out. And after thousands of years in darkness and without the sun sun without the sun's energy, excuse me. That would create some other light and energy onto vostera and that be as a dwarf. I came from the mountains, uh, and my sister, uh, came from the woods, uh, and my brother would have come from. He was also an else in the woods. Of this story. Did you have any children? Uh, no, I. It was more of a solitary guy. I always found it a bit weird.

[Speaker 9]
Or anything?

[Speaker 5]
I'm, yes, that's correct. I'm not opportunity. Yes.

[Speaker 2]
So, which was either you were adopted or it was Immaculate Conception from the mountains.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, I guess

[Speaker 2]
We tell you something about that.

[Speaker 1]
Theoretically, popul.

[Speaker 5]
Well, yes, it is. That is the idea, um,

[Speaker 1]
But you did.

[Speaker 5]
I, myself, did not, at least, not. Well. Maybe there were some magical means of doing so, but I didn't, but you're simply procreating the best.

[Speaker 1]
Yes, that is correct.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah,

[Speaker 5]
Again,

[Speaker 2]
Not

[Speaker 5]
Blood related, at least not that we know

[Speaker 3]
To be clear. And now, you're saying that you're a virgin. How would you be certain?

[Speaker 5]
Well, there are beings of, you know, protection, even in back in the days. There were beads.

[Speaker 3]
You can never know for sure.

[Speaker 1]
Well, I was,

[Speaker 5]
Well,

[Speaker 2]
My sex life is not as interesting as serious, I

[Speaker 1]
Swear. Uno. Have you ever really? Try to look into if your mom, maybe it didn't adopt you, but like stole you from. Somebody

[Speaker 5]
Just told me, cuz we

[Speaker 1]
Found these old civilizations, right? They had they were they were with the Titans. They were. But uh, they were taking their energy from them. And what if you're just one of their kids and like, she just stole you from the old? Place. She collected all you little little guys left over and was, like, I'm the last one or I'm the first one.

[Speaker 5]
But. How would we have survived? So long, and how would we have remained as children?

[Speaker 1]
You stay. Children, no. I, I don't know the exact Logistics of how she could have killed everyone else stolen the kids. I'll

[Speaker 5]
Tell you what that does sound more realistic than me, be born born out of a mountain. Yeah, from

[Speaker 1]
What

[Speaker 5]
I know of biology so far, I just

[Speaker 1]
Don't usually associate very kind, adoptive mothers with getting like 45 kids. I feel like that's like Army level.

[Speaker 1]
Nice lady. Well, she

[Speaker 5]
Wasn't. If it helps, he was more military in her style of parenting. Um. All of us have different feelings about how. So?

[Speaker 4]
Right? Yes, um, so this guy you can, like, only cast it once. Is that why you can't?

[Speaker 5]
It takes a long time, but a vast amount of energy to cast. Um, I won't be able to cast this Bell again for quite some time. Um. I'm warning you, your brother will not be the same as he was before.

[Speaker 3]
Feels better than what we have now.

[Speaker 5]
I admit that this is probably quite. Unhealthy, mentally.

[Speaker 5]
Starts.

[Speaker 5]
An hour also. Um.

[Speaker 5]
Well, at first it will, uh, we need an intermediary body to kind of. Have a state, an empty state for me to? Go from one to the other, and I have to keep casting the spell. As I'm transferring my Consciousness, so it was a pretty complicated spell. Um, a very much will be helping me, uh, he will actually be providing most of the actual energy into the spell. I trust all of you, um, to some extent. Um. I would appreciate it if you left me some space. I will be. Performing the spell. Just a little bit of ways away. I'll be in view of you, of course, since I know not all of you trust me, um.

[Speaker 5]
But just for my own safety. I will be very vulnerable podcast, so I hope you understand if you wanted to find take notes. Take notes, okay?

[Speaker 2]
We could go. Go back to the facility.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah. I

[Speaker 3]
Think it's only going to be an hour.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, we could just sit there and watch. I think I think we should probably wait.

[Speaker 3]
Okay. Also, did you guys see my message?

[Speaker 1]
I did. Yeah, cuz Meg was, like, also quickly cast death forward on barehood just in case I don't know. I want to make sure that he's okay, that's unbearable. And the dragon? Because, like, I don't know when, if someone shows up and they're, like, oh?

[Speaker 5]
Uh, the dragon nods slightly. It accepts your gift. Um, he, uh, takes off on berman's, um, unless any of you have anything to say about this, but he takes off on bearment with, uh, his old body and the body of the freshly killed.

[Speaker 5]
They fly off and they fly off to like a little spot in in the valley. That's kind of like below this this Cliff. He makes like a little space. Uh, he, like, clears the snow. And then he immediately lays, uh, both of the bodies there. He starts. Drawing, like, some kind of like arcade sigils next to both of the bodies. And he starts casting his belt. So, what are you guys doing during this hour?

[Speaker 5]
Like,

[Speaker 2]
I don't want to go see what's happening with the Titan. Problems, taking notes,

[Speaker 5]
Taking notes. I think that you want to do a clippy.

[Speaker 3]
How far away is he

[Speaker 5]
Famous? He's, I mean, you can probably walk there, uh, within, like, you know? Of like

[Speaker 3]
10 15 minutes.

[Speaker 3]
I'll probably want to stay. Stay close to where he's at all, right.

[Speaker 5]
You stay close.

[Speaker 1]
I will. Meg will prepare some tea because I assume once you switch bodies, you feel sick.

[Speaker 2]
This always makes them deep.

[Speaker 5]
That's all it does. It's all together.

[Speaker 1]
You

[Speaker 5]
Guys! All do kind of your own thing for the next hour. As he starts casting the spell, you see that bearman, kind of, like, puts his like snout towards, uh, the body that he will inhabit, uh? And he puts like both arms on. One on his old body and went on either. There is a long period of time where effectively they are both just immobile and nothing happens. Uh, there is a point at which. Uh, Phineas collapses to the ground. Key collapses, uh. And then, a few moments later, uh, Edith Rises. And where, before there was like a hole through her throat from the spell that he cast to kill her, uh, it just like, kind of rejoins.

[Speaker 5]
And he she stands up.

[Speaker 3]
How far away am I when?

[Speaker 5]
You can. You can run towards there. Once you see, I can

[Speaker 3]
Be like within, like, close to them.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, absolutely. Um.

[Speaker 5]
As the process finishes, uh?

[Speaker 3]
Out.

[Speaker 2]
My answer is also dope.

[Speaker 3]
Okay.

[Speaker 2]
Wait, that's no, wait. My answer to this question,

[Speaker 3]
Yes, is yes,

[Speaker 2]
Oh, okay,

[Speaker 3]
Oh yeah,

[Speaker 1]
Oh, and the

[Speaker 2]
Question. So hurry, yes, yes.

[Speaker 2]
That's wow, what the travels for?

[Speaker 5]
You guys!

[Speaker 5]
You walk, you run towards where this now is is ending. And you go towards Phineas's body. And where once there was this? Uh, of voice and a presence that you did not recognize in your brother. Uh, Bowther is a very strange just kind of like blank expression on Phineas's face. He looks at you, and he kind of just like.

[Speaker 3]
Phineas. All right. Are you back?

[Speaker 5]
I just starts crying.

[Speaker 3]
I, I go, and I give him a hug,

[Speaker 5]
Uh? He does not know what to do with his body. Um, you immediately recognize these cries as effectively. The whales of a child? Um. He is grabbing on to you, uh, like a child would. For their mother. Um. Uno, uh, rises from Edith's body now. Um, and kind of just gives you some space, uh, he, like hops on to Berman's. And he, just like, gives you a little bit of space. Um. He goes.

[Speaker 5]
Um, Phineas, uh, kind of, like, is. Prime at first, and then he kind of like tries to grab your shoulders and kind of look at you a little bit more intensely, um. You feel like you recognize this kind of, like, empty, confused, look, um? As very similar to what durable dumb looks like when he first wakes up, um. Exactly looks much more confused and scared. Um. But it's just.

[Speaker 2]
That's crazy.

[Speaker 5]
Um. After a while, uh, Uno. It goes towards you and goes. I'm sorry, I truly am. Um. What what's happened to him? Well.

[Speaker 5]
Your brother was effectively born.

[Speaker 5]
I think. Even when I was inhabiting in his body, I could tell that he was still there if that helps. Um.

[Speaker 5]
I try my best to.

[Speaker 5]
Um, was my first time casting the spell, but? I don't think I can flee erase what someone is. There may be some part of him left in there.

[Speaker 5]
He was just born again.

[Speaker 5]
Maybe give it some time? I'm sorry. Um. Should I go right back?

[Speaker 1]
I and

[Speaker 3]
There's only one thing kite would do in this situations. And I'm sorry if you guys don't like it, but. Kate's gonna go right up to him. Put an end on your shoulder. Go under a rage and stab him with her, his beer.

[Speaker 1]
Not even a punch just

[Speaker 2]
Straight for the spear.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, now

[Speaker 2]
Go for it.

[Speaker 3]
And actually does this, she says. Are? Of being, you are a monster.

[Speaker 3]
Recklessly attacking. Uh,

[Speaker 2]
That

[Speaker 3]
Is a 28, uh, oh, actually. I have one right now.

[Speaker 5]
That absolutely hits one for damage. Uh,

[Speaker 1]
I need a check.

[Speaker 5]
This is the first level 11.

[Speaker 1]
Yes, 27.

[Speaker 1]
Um, I will.

[Speaker 3]
Uh, yeah, I'll just I guess.

[Speaker 1]
Uh, that is.

[Speaker 3]
14 damage.

[Speaker 5]
Okay. Uh, I'll start marking down his headboards. Okay, uh, who would be near you were taking notes? Yeah, I would say no, so you both of you would be there and see this happening

[Speaker 3]
16 damage because of range

[Speaker 2]
16 puts a damage? Oh, can we go and try to restrain, uh, Kate,

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, you absolutely can!

[Speaker 5]
Um. 69 what you said? Okay. I'm Gonna Roll for an initiative, uh, everyone who's involved mobile for initiative. Up. Remember,

[Speaker 2]
Me and lavender are gone completely forgot, he existed. Yeah, he does. He doesn't need existence for weeks. Is?

[Speaker 2]
We, we talk, is free again, right? We go kite, calm down. I have a

[Speaker 1]
14.

[Speaker 5]
14.

[Speaker 1]
I got 50.

[Speaker 5]
Let's see what bear mud rolls.

[Speaker 2]
Right, we got a nine.

[Speaker 5]
Oh my God.

[Speaker 1]
Back bending. Dang! It firm was going mad at me.

[Speaker 5]
That is not create. Haven't you nine nine

[Speaker 1]
15,

[Speaker 5]
15.

[Speaker 2]
I'll see you guys in the next campaign.

[Speaker 5]
Meg and? Uh, yeah, so both Uno and Berman? You're rolled really high on their initiative. Uh, how much did you roll

[Speaker 3]
14, 14?

[Speaker 5]
Um. Uno is first as soon as you stab him. He immediately, uh, starts casting a spell. Make a wisdom safe and throw.

[Speaker 5]
How

[Speaker 2]
To get held?

[Speaker 1]
He's so nice that he holds you instead of killing you. Like, what? I'm gonna steal this.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah,

[Speaker 3]
12,

[Speaker 5]
12. You fail, uh, you are helped, uh, and as he immediately, he starts pushing back u. He, like, holds the stab wound and he goes. Killing me won't bring him back, uh, and as he moves forward, you see Baron Moon immediately. Like, goes to, like, try and bite you in his jaws, uh, and he, like, holds out an arm and stops him. Holding you? He goes. I understand, it's painful. I've seen many of my friends die. Everyone, except my sister. Died. I understand, but it's not going to bring him back. And he jumps on top of Berman and he flies away.

[Speaker 5]
After a while, you are unheld.

[Speaker 3]
Um. K is going to. Uh, drop to the ground, I guess. As. Old person hands. And she's obviously. Crying. Ugly crying, sobbing her her heart out, and she goes over back to. To Phineas and just starts. Trying to talk to him? Um, just the most like, meaningless, inane things. Stuff from like the the childhood or whatever, and things trying to say things and trying to get some sort of response from him. Uh, not really being. The most logical at the moment.

[Speaker 5]
Make a procession check.

[Speaker 3]
Equation.

[Speaker 1]
18,

[Speaker 5]
15. Um. There's just like this. Blank, expressionless, confused, and scared face. And as you like, start crying. He starts crying as well. Um. He doesn't understand what's going on.

[Speaker 5]
Um, but he holds you. He holds you tight and. He trusts you to some extent. All of you now, like, kind of joined the situation. You guys are free to do as much.

[Speaker 1]
This may go offer some of the teeth she made for Uno to kite and. If they'll take it.

[Speaker 3]
Uh, cake takes one of the cuts and starts trying to feed it to Phineas.

[Speaker 10]
He drinks what he gets something.

[Speaker 1]
Thank you.

[Speaker 5]
Recognize, uh, kind of. Very empty and confused expression on his face.

[Speaker 5]
You I. What does double dumb feel when he sees this?

[Speaker 1]
It's like, it's a mirror.

[Speaker 2]
Over down the season with him.

[Speaker 2]
He's, he seems. Kite. I know your brother. It may seem like he's gone, but. But I think he could still be in there.

[Speaker 1]
How are you working

[Speaker 2]
Guys that look on his face? Don't you see it on me every morning? I think if you're going to collect enough. Enough memories enough memorabilia enough things from your past to? To jump his memory, you could give him back the same way that. I come to my senses every morning, but you need to rehabilitate your brother. Slowly bit by this. Telling the stories of your childhood. He could come back.

[Speaker 3]
This is actually like a thing that I thought. Like, when I was creating my character, but I, I pull out a little, uh? But tiny, like. Task. Like a task of a board. And I hold it from my pocket. And uh, because part of the things is, I get like a memorabilia from a important kill. Uh, in my equipment, and I. This is the first Beast I ever slayed. I, I killed it because of you. You, you're out playing. Well in the wildlands End.

[Speaker 5]
And

[Speaker 3]
All of a sudden, you got jumped by. Jumped by this giant Pig and? Ever since. Since then, I've always been having to be the one that. Protects you and looks after you and. I'm sorry that this time.

[Speaker 3]
And I take the little little one, and I put it into it and wrap

[Speaker 1]
This hand around.

[Speaker 5]
He grabs it. Um. Kind of opens it and looks at it. There's like a delightful Glee on his face. He seems very intrigued by this object. He kind of like takes it in his other hand, and like inspects it. Um, and for a moment, you see what you love so much about your little brother. Is this, like, very curious, motivated individual that wants to figure out how the world works, um, and you see that, like, look of curiosity in his life for just a second? It just seems to like inspect it, and like, turn it around in his palm, and like he feels that he plays with it for a bit, um.

[Speaker 5]
There's this odd childlike wonder that, once annoyed, you is. Now to you, like a a. A Beacon of hope that he is still there.

[Speaker 2]
Um. Yep,

[Speaker 5]
He continues playing with it.

[Speaker 1]
Um, yeah, I think.

[Speaker 3]
At this point. Kate wants to try and do more, but It's been. This has been very draining and all she can do is just sit there with him and watch him. Flavor a little tusk.

[Speaker 5]
You take some time to? Kind of like recoup from what just happened emotionally. Um. Is there anything that the two of you want to do?

[Speaker 1]
Can make, asks Cindy. Am I gonna walk away from this steam just not to be so intensive? Um, but if she could kind of sending through Uno and just potentially be like, you know?

[Speaker 5]
You get a message back. He goes. I'm behind. It's annoying to appeals to fresh body, but Be fine.

[Speaker 1]
And ascending the one where you limited words.

[Speaker 1]
Do you want me to come over there and help? I have healing hours for themselves.

[Speaker 5]
It's fine. I appreciate the concern, but we should be okay. Um. Double them. Did you have anything in mind?

[Speaker 2]
No one looks like height, and he says. Let me know if you like, try this money, but? A Kickstart. Your brother. Regaining of his memory. If we were to if you were to tell me about something very important to his identity in events that happened in his life that you can recall and describe, and I can attempt to recreate it with as much accurate accuracy as possible, and it modifies memory to include it. That could be? The nucleation point. All his other memories to fall in place.

[Speaker 2]
You can think on. You couldn't think about this.

[Speaker 2]
Think about our every every site, every sound if I can recreate it as inaccurately as possible. Might should be enough.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, who's like she's currently on her on her knees, like next to Phoenix right now, like reaches her paw. It's adorable dumbasses and pass them on the sizes. I, I can't thank you enough. You can never know.

[Speaker 3]
What you're offering, how much it could

[Speaker 2]
Costly mean to me. Drop. Don't mention it. You've saved! You've saved my budget several times already. And then rubber Dome looks at looks at kite as well. So, here's one thing. There's one thing that I've wanted to try. Because it does kite have vaccine have work, right?

[Speaker 3]
Yeah,

[Speaker 2]
Does kite have a tail?

[Speaker 3]
Um, she's got like a little small tail like, oh, okay, then you probably wouldn't have. I thought it would be

[Speaker 2]
A big fluffy tail, you know,

[Speaker 3]
It's more. It's kind of like a deer tail, almost like that sort of like.

[Speaker 2]
Wow, small hill.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, I mean, you can't. You can't see it

[Speaker 2]
Normal. Okay, then. Then double them actually. Never had a desire to touch it. The big, fluffy tail because it never existed almost all mattresses of, oh,

[Speaker 3]
These big, fluffy ears, though.

[Speaker 5]
There's nothing Mane.

[Speaker 2]
Don't worry, it's. I may not look like it, but this is my area of expertise. I'm happy to talk.

[Speaker 1]
And if you ever want to go into his dreams? I can let you go in. I like, just tap you on the shoulder and you can talk down while you sleep and.

[Speaker 3]
That would be.

[Speaker 5]
You guys reconvened, um? What are you doing? Let me time, I just want to go look down the hole. Yep, what hold? Ah yes, uh, you look down, uh, I mean. So, you guys. You left it open, right? Yep. Still there, facing directly pointed towards the Sun.

[Speaker 2]
Can I like? Is anything moving? Stabilizer

[Speaker 5]
Ever was?

[Speaker 2]
I guess I'll kind of just like, sit down and enjoy the video. Yeah.

[Speaker 5]
Um. Lavender, uh, is next to you, and he goes.

[Speaker 5]
Can we kill the

[Speaker 2]
Vespara?

[Speaker 2]
I don't know. We don't,

[Speaker 5]
Really. These things are pretty cool, and he just like pulls up. Right?

[Speaker 2]
Pretty useful. This is the coolest thing I've ever held.

[Speaker 5]
It's too bad I can't charge them up.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah,

[Speaker 5]
Formally, I

[Speaker 2]
Feel the same about that.

[Speaker 5]
Ah, it would be so cool.

[Speaker 5]
It's okay,

[Speaker 2]
I mean, adorable. Dump seems to be pretty enthusiastic about. Filling these, uh, these bad boys up. Great game! You want to take a shot?

[Speaker 5]
Yes, uh, he grabs it, and he was playing with it.

[Speaker 2]
No, I like, I gotta like, KB, you have to be very careful, all right.

[Speaker 5]
Will be. What do you want me to aim for?

[Speaker 2]
I able like the complete opposite directions.

[Speaker 5]
Okay, uh, he took this shot.

[Speaker 3]
Do

[Speaker 5]
You give him that one or another one?

[Speaker 2]
I give him another one.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, you guys have an empty one, um. The case, he misses. He misses, but it's not too bad of a shot.

[Speaker 2]
Um.

[Speaker 5]
You guys kind of sit down there for a while, uh, eventually all of you reconvene. You reconvene outside of where Uno is at. So, you guys can have like a proper conversation for now. What do you guys do?

[Speaker 2]
Whoa, you're right, we got a we want to just in case destroy the the triple cylinder again,

[Speaker 1]
Right?

[Speaker 2]
Because that could power the machine that teleports armies so? Want to like, break the glass and then and then see how many containers we can find at store. As much of this stuff as possible?

[Speaker 1]
How

[Speaker 2]
Big is this thing? How big is what?

[Speaker 1]
Oh,

[Speaker 2]
It's gigantic,

[Speaker 5]
Uh, I mean, like, as I said before, it's like it goes throughout levels.

[Speaker 5]
Sorry, does that make sense? Yeah, yeah, it's

[Speaker 1]
Huge. Yeah.

[Speaker 5]
Uh, and it goes like. So, there you continue exploring this facility over, you know, the past few days until?

[Speaker 5]
There are maybe like 20 or so floors. Most of them don't have much in them. They're effectively just like a container for the Titan that is there. Um, but there are actually probably even more than that. I mean, it's 100 meters tall, so that would be like, maybe? To like three floors. I want to say. Um. And this, like cylinder spans for about, like half of them, if not more.

[Speaker 2]
Able to access the bottom of the cylinder. You

[Speaker 5]
Could, yeah,

[Speaker 2]
Let's drain this baby.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, at least the machine on board. We would be filling up probably multiple floors full of triangle.

[Speaker 2]
Mean. Yeah,

[Speaker 5]
Well,

[Speaker 2]
We'll collect as much as we can otherwise. Like, the triple is, what makes this thing work? Yeah, you can otherwise just bury it or get it on the ground or just put it somewhere. Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
Have we observed like this triple and it's liquid state ever like absorbing into anything? I feel like,

[Speaker 3]
No,

[Speaker 2]
We've never seen another liquid state, right?

[Speaker 1]
Well, we'll see, maybe absorb into the ground.

[Speaker 2]
A groundwater pollution is so. This stuff transmits magic, like through it.

[Speaker 5]
So,

[Speaker 2]
Like if you drink this stuff and someone casts a spelling, so it's okay,

[Speaker 1]
It's going.

[Speaker 2]
I could like I could die. Right? If we're not careful if someone casts like Fireball like that, I'm, you might well become the fire alarm. Yeah, it's internally. Internal Fireball. You should find someone that won't find a drink there. That would be an insane way to kill someone. To make them drink triple and then cast like a six little Fireball into it.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, look at poison. Mascara had a little banquet.

[Speaker 3]
I just want to test it on him.

[Speaker 2]
This. This thing is progressing so fast. Yeah. Is it unethical to experiment on like? One of the monkeys.

[Speaker 5]
Obvious.

[Speaker 2]
For

[Speaker 5]
It.

[Speaker 3]
They're evil. Okay,

[Speaker 2]
There.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah,

[Speaker 1]
Peter's giving you on our app. It could be worth it, cuz I'm I'm so open to like multiple phases of trying to kill them. If,

[Speaker 2]
Like, the triple is huge because we can use it for a lot of things. Like, let's say, I don't have, like, if you guys each whole triple right,

[Speaker 1]
The

[Speaker 2]
Irs Bell can like you and me could cast bells through it through you guys to her right

[Speaker 1]
Shoot, multiple guns into the same.

[Speaker 1]
Really make sure she doesn't too much,

[Speaker 2]
Right? You could go Point Blank and hold up like, you know, a vial, and then I could. You know? Shoot from the safe distance.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, only only we would be in trouble.

[Speaker 2]
If it's on you, we can access. We can cast spells on to you guys. See you guys those big hot as I was banking on you taking it.

[Speaker 5]
There's there's like a lot of it.

[Speaker 2]
There's a lot of it. Okay,

[Speaker 1]
I didn't even eat too close at all. I could just cast like Mass restoration on everyone. It just has it. Yeah.

[Speaker 2]
My head is not keeping up with all of this. It's. Well, that's not my character. That's like. Oh well, let's just I heard we're supposed to. We have to go capture

[Speaker 3]
Monkey. Guess what? I, who's going to capture a lot?

[Speaker 2]
You should practice on the monkey.

[Speaker 3]
And he'll catch among you

[Speaker 5]
All right. So,

[Speaker 2]
Division of labor?

[Speaker 3]
I will find a monkey. No guys, the monkey is a encounter. We need to all fight the monkey.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, we will find the monkey together. We go to the bottom of this big container of tribal

[Speaker 5]
Guys. If you just want to catch a monkey, you can do that. It's not going to be an encounter. You'll wait until a lonely, sad, little Bunkie is.

[Speaker 5]
Happens

[Speaker 2]
Upon a monkey, just beating its children.

[Speaker 5]
The monkeys are racist.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, everybody takes a child

[Speaker 2]
And those monkeys, a pedophile. Is that a weird little mustache? It's the worst monkey ever.

[Speaker 5]
It's the worst monkey, five

[Speaker 2]
More things to another child, monkey a different race.

[Speaker 5]
Okay, so um, what I'm trying is that this is

[Speaker 3]
Maybe not the best monkey to choose, because if we get a giant super monkey, and then we give it a bunch of magic powers. We're gonna make a Unstoppable racist book.

[Speaker 5]
Try, I don't think triple will give it any power today.

[Speaker 1]
Well,

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, this is. An insane encounter. I think we could take it, right? We've got. We'll have, um,

[Speaker 1]
We can just run away,

[Speaker 2]
What dude we can kill this monkey, no problem. Hemlock stands by with the six level spell slab, right? Aim at its head and we will dust

[Speaker 1]
Okay.

[Speaker 2]
See what happened,

[Speaker 1]
Then we know that we should be drinking it.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah,

[Speaker 5]
Not yet.

[Speaker 2]
The logic of sound?

[Speaker 5]
Knowledge is power.

[Speaker 5]
You guys are just unit seven three one like?

[Speaker 2]
The first thing we do is let's, how much of the tribal do you think we can collect, like how many containers of it could be reasonably get. I mean, you guys

[Speaker 5]
Like, find stuff that could be a container for triple everywhere in this building. Ever. Again, you're encountering the same problem by, like, you have a limited amount of space and stuff you can carry, um. And also an intact like cylinder or jar. Uh, that is like, capable of holding this liquid is not infinite. Like, there is a limited amount of those. You can put them in buckets like you can find, like buckets, and like, you know, boxes, and whatever, uh, but something that would like chromatically contain it, um. You don't find that much of it, maybe like enough to fill like, you know, like two buckets or something, like, how am I like two buckets worth.

[Speaker 2]
Can I fill a flask of it? Yeah,

[Speaker 5]
Absolutely. Right?

[Speaker 1]
Five dollars,

[Speaker 2]
Jars, jars, flasks, you know, vials, whatever we can find. We'll collect those. We're just at the bottom of it, just you like, crack up. We break it open, as it's all flowing out. We're just collecting it. Is anyone else nervous?

[Speaker 1]
It's just so big and scary at this point that I feel like we can't make it that much worse. Yeah.

[Speaker 5]
So, just as of know you were in, uh, Titanfall, where, uh, pretty explicitly, everything around you was affected with tripolo, so you know that there is at least some form of triple that is highly dangerous. That form came to be, and how it relates to the one that you're seeing inside here. You're not sure.

[Speaker 2]
Right, probably

[Speaker 3]
Fine, but I'm

[Speaker 5]
Just telling you that's something that you do. Remember,

[Speaker 1]
We went to a place that had a lot of triple. If you cast it and you spell your spelling, wouldn't do the thing that you thought it would like. You would catch like Fireball, and you, someone would have a wardrobe wall function.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, what? Yeah, somebody

[Speaker 2]
Was involved, and you

[Speaker 1]
Feel sick if your magic happens.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, just refreshing your members,

[Speaker 2]
And it did. Legitimately, almost kill a cat.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, I imaginary creature in the area. Actually,

[Speaker 2]
Wow.

[Speaker 5]
To be very clear. There was like a like a gigantic radius around this place where no living being was there. Like, there no things remaining

[Speaker 1]
You.

[Speaker 5]
How much of it is there? Of the liquid, I mean. Like, a lot. It's again, it's like 15 floors of like a cylinder that's about as wide as this room.

[Speaker 1]
And

[Speaker 5]
The the layer of glass is thin, so it's like the center of it is empty of triple. Does that make sense? It's like a double wall of glass, and the treble is contained within the double wall. Yeah.

[Speaker 2]
So, it's not a crazy, okay. I don't know why, but I feel like destroying it is not the pipe.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, that's fair

[Speaker 2]
Because, like, when you're trying to get rid of nuclear reactor, you don't like shoot it with a bomb, right? But we also don't want to leave it on functioning nuclear reactor. Maybe we could like break it in the right places?

[Speaker 2]
I think the cuz with this thing, the rarest. And most essential part of it. That makes it work is the triple, and that would be take the most effort for them to. You know for them to get it up and running again because we like, leave the trifle here. They could probably pretty easily just rebuild the glass if we break it to rebuild the other stuff to break it. Surely, there's more to this mechanism than just the glass of the trifle, right? Uh, but like the tribal is the one we know very for sure, they cannot send power. They don't have the triangle.

[Speaker 2]
Bring more. Try. They have an infinite supply of triple. They have the entire entice control, right,

[Speaker 1]
And they are. Have we seen them using triple across the world yet?

[Speaker 5]
Uh, yes, I mean, Vespero has used it against you many times as? Well, I

[Speaker 3]
Guess he doesn't remember anything anymore.

[Speaker 5]
Um, it's not as common as Los cellos as far as like, uh, you know, practical applications of etherits go, like, at this point LaSalles is like a relatively common thing, uh, you know, like, even peasants would have, like, known of it? Travel is more rare, has some practical applications, but so far isn't as popular. Well, we've seen like a like a shed load of it, right? But yeah, you guys, you guys have seen like a much larger amount in it, it was being, uh. Like, there were the you saw, uh, that truck was being mined that there were like schemes for, uh, weapons that used triple in them.

[Speaker 5]
Some of them kind of actually remind you of the weapons that you found here.

[Speaker 1]
Um,

[Speaker 2]
Yeah. Okay. I do want to collect it though. Are we still okay to collect

[Speaker 3]
Triple? Yeah,

[Speaker 2]
Collect as much as we can carry

[Speaker 3]
Breaking at like the tops doesn't

[Speaker 2]
Empty all up. Okay, yeah, and it is relatively skin safe. So, so okay, here's what we do.

[Speaker 5]
Are we still testing he putting up his butt? I forgot about that.

[Speaker 2]
We're at the top, you know, we break whole, you know? Find two, go well, of course. Siphons it, like? And it starts blowing out. We start. We fill up all our containers. Um, I guess, however, and then. Are we leaving it intact? Is that the plan? I think we leave the glass. But. I mean, I, I don't know. I guess I'm assuming it like. This is, like, some, like, really complex Machinery with, like these cogs, and? Fucking. No, I

[Speaker 5]
Mean, this container itself seems relatively simple. You don't see anything obvious about, like the mechanics behind it. And none of you are have enough context or insight to know how it actually works. Um, you're kind of just. I'm gonna have to, like, guess. Um, as to what like the consequence of this might be.

[Speaker 2]
I mean, I guess we don't have to do this right now.

[Speaker 1]
Because

[Speaker 2]
Quote, I mean, what else is left to do in this place before we adventure off somewhere else?

[Speaker 1]
No, I wish we could let Titan go, but you can't get out of this hole.

[Speaker 2]
Porky's not moving either? Jesus, he's just charging.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, we can just leave them charging.

[Speaker 2]
He's not being, he's not plugged in anymore, so you know we

[Speaker 1]
Could destroy the plug like, at least, like if they wanted to use him, they'd have to rebuild the cords.

[Speaker 2]
Wreck all the Machinery in this place. Yeah, well, wreck, go, whoa, whoa! What does vandalize the whole place?

[Speaker 1]
About the driveway.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah. Okay, you guys vandalize the shit out of this place.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, yep, no problem. You guys are very, it's a very cathartic thing for types?

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, absolutely. Smashing stuff, this whole place becomes a rage room for you. That's great. A literal rage room? Yep, absolutely.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, I

[Speaker 1]
Was gonna say. Could we go through and also like, gather up all the identifying materials? And just like, keep those. Yeah, absolutely. You

[Speaker 5]
Keep like a bunch of knick-knacks from this place.

[Speaker 1]
On top

[Speaker 5]
Of like the weapons and the vests. Um, yeah, you gather like an array of objects from here. Um, yeah,

[Speaker 2]
All right. We've got our. We got the triple, and uh. Monkey time.

[Speaker 3]
Okay,

[Speaker 5]
Okay,

[Speaker 3]
So all right,

[Speaker 5]
Yes, so you've analyzed this place that's done? For the triple. Ask you, how are you guys planning on doing this very specifically because this is like? You're messing with a nuclear reactor more or

[Speaker 3]
Less getting the triple or yeah.

[Speaker 5]
Okay,

[Speaker 1]
What's the trouble doing anything right now? So, just sitting there,

[Speaker 5]
It's just sitting there before it was spinning. Now, I was just standing still. It seems to like be waiting for something to actually activate and spin.

[Speaker 2]
Being safe because we've unplugged the power source, right? So,

[Speaker 1]
It should last a picture of the glass if we touch it. Is it warm, cool.

[Speaker 5]
Uh, when it was like spinning, uh, it was warm. It kind of like, emanated, uh, warmth, uh. Now, it's cold, it's, you know, root temperature.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, okay, let's let's. Let's, let's think about how we're gonna actually extract it, uh, do we have anything?

[Speaker 3]
I mean Type is willing to just sit there, crack it open while you guys stand, like 600 feet away if you want. Um,

[Speaker 2]
Let's, let's try something, could we, could we? I'd like to try freezing it, so it's not a liquid, and it won't get everywhere and we can just collect it as in solid chunks. So, look, if, uh? If I use, like? It's like ray of frost, but not as an attached just to like,

[Speaker 5]
No,

[Speaker 2]
Does it. Does it solidify, or does it stay liquid? It

[Speaker 5]
Does not seem to solidify me okay.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, so it just stays liquid.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, looks weird when it was mine didn't stop mine. It was obviously solid. It was

[Speaker 5]
Solid. It was a gem effectively.

[Speaker 3]
I can turn my bill into liquid.

[Speaker 2]
His ways, I guess. Maybe it's some sort of alloy? Yeah. Um, well. Does anyone have any ideas otherwise? I think we just have kite smash it, and just

[Speaker 1]
I would try to make the smaller school you possibly can, cuz, that I can cast mending if we wanted to like, mend it back together.

[Speaker 3]
If you wanted to, I'll I'll think of an area. Do you mending on

[Speaker 1]
No larger than one foot in dimension?

[Speaker 3]
Okay, the whole zombie do that there. Okay,

[Speaker 2]
I mean, it's glass. You could just shattered.

[Speaker 2]
Or something? Small hole with what did you do with the claw? Like, oh yeah, oh yeah, yeah.

[Speaker 5]
You want to do the Spy movie thing? Yeah, yeah,

[Speaker 3]
I am a Catwoman. Yeah,

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, you

[Speaker 5]
Can drive. I'll

[Speaker 1]
Say.

[Speaker 5]
Slate of hand? I think there's more of, like, an attack roll really.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah,

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, make an attack roll.

[Speaker 3]
All right.

[Speaker 1]
13. It's

[Speaker 5]
Not like the pressure and the force of your claws alone is not enough to like. Go through this pain of glass.

[Speaker 2]
Is it etched?

[Speaker 5]
It's Edge, like it's scratched. Johnny,

[Speaker 3]
What if I go into a rage?

[Speaker 5]
I always let you try again. With Advantage. Obviously,

[Speaker 3]
I was gonna say, what if I wreck, go see it? No, such a terrible idea. Just in the name, we're trying to not be right back here.

[Speaker 1]
I will,

[Speaker 5]
It's just a name. It's 11. Jesus, uh, no, the? Like, you're very afraid of, like applying too much pressure on it. And just like the, yeah, your claws aren't like sharp enough to actually, um. Do what you wanted to do. You'll probably have to like. I mean, it's glass. It's, it's fragile to, you know, bludgeoning damage?

[Speaker 1]
No,

[Speaker 2]
But it's it's. It's Edge, you know? You can try just punching that that either goal. Maybe it'll pop out that area?

[Speaker 5]
You can drive.

[Speaker 3]
I'm looking if I have anything else.

[Speaker 5]
He also has a bunch of arrows. Wait without.

[Speaker 3]
Could we melt the glass? Because I have family is normal. Caught. Lots of things have feed him up class.

[Speaker 5]
Really hot, really. Pretty hot,

[Speaker 2]
Really hot. We don't know what that'll do today. Yeah. Me now that it's etched?

[Speaker 3]
I can just try and punch it and punch

[Speaker 2]
It. I'm gonna use an arrow and just keep going around and around on that on the edge.

[Speaker 5]
You can't do that as well. Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
It's made me safer than the punch.

[Speaker 5]
Just complete tracing that Circle.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, yeah, it'll take time,

[Speaker 5]
Uh, but eventually. Also. Eventually, you are able to get to a point where you think if you're just like apply. I'm definitely wearing

[Speaker 3]
The vest right now. By the way, this is the best moment. Okay, that's a good

[Speaker 5]
Idea. Yeah, you think that, like, you just need to effectively just like punch through it, uh, and it will open up like a small hole.

[Speaker 3]
All, right? Well, then, I'll go. I'll make sure everybody's ready. Everybody is. Safe spot.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, anybody have a source of iodine?

[Speaker 1]
Huh?

[Speaker 5]
That's a yeah, the nuclear reactor thing.

[Speaker 3]
Hopefully, I don't die. Okay, iodine, all right, nevermind. Yeah, I got

[Speaker 5]
It.

[Speaker 3]
Hey, country, so

[Speaker 2]
Absolutions,

[Speaker 5]
Uh, you punched the glass, uh, the part that you etch shatters. I'll say just straight luck. Just roll D20, see what happens. You want a high score

[Speaker 3]
Based on how this is

[Speaker 2]
Going so far.

[Speaker 1]
Inspiration,

[Speaker 5]
Nope. Just luck.

[Speaker 5]
17, 17, perfect! It goes exactly as planned. Uh, you punch it and only the part that you had etched out like shatters. And there starts to be like a small trickle of this kind of like. Purple-Ish liquid, and it starts like you guys start gathering like the things that you had planned to kind of fill it up. Um, it has this weird like Mercurial consistency. I'll say you get a little bit on your fur and you do take. Uh, just three points of acid damage. It seems to not be.

[Speaker 1]
Something about this liquid

[Speaker 5]
Is definitely not meant to be inside someone's body.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, well, that's good, right? It'll do acid damage when we made. That's very good

[Speaker 1]
Drink. Yeah, right.

[Speaker 5]
You guys collect, I'll say, uh. Two jarfuls or two, you know, bucketfuls of this thing? And a flask.

[Speaker 3]
This is a class

[Speaker 5]
And a flask. Uh, what is your flask made of?

[Speaker 2]
I don't know. He never told me.

[Speaker 5]
I feel like most flasks around this time would be made of, like a leather skin.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, I am at, let's see.

[Speaker 5]
The

[Speaker 2]
Only description is nice and boozy. Okay,

[Speaker 5]
Roll another electric just D20. More than 10, then it's made out of metal.

[Speaker 2]
Yep, it's made of metal. This bag, okay? Don't accidentally drink. It's true.

[Speaker 5]
Okay, but you guys gather u?

[Speaker 3]
All right. Time to feed the monkey.

[Speaker 5]
Where are you guys putting these like containers full? Are you just like stuffing them in your backpacks and stuff?

[Speaker 2]
Do we have room in the backup holding? Yes,

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, so you do have a little bit more space

[Speaker 2]
Technically, right? I mean, this thing is supposed to have a weight and weight wise. I can hold a lot more.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, there's more, the volume. Maybe that's yeah. You guys find some space in the bag folding part. Let's say this

[Speaker 2]
Feels like a safe place to put,

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, right next

[Speaker 2]
To all of the guns.

[Speaker 5]
I mean. Magically charged rail guns. It was like this is gonna become like a. This is gonna be like 20 Fireballs worth of like level six Fireballs worth of spells of, like, they're sitting right next to this jar of dynamite. This is, I

[Speaker 3]
Think this is how we create a Lich. We have a skull

[Speaker 5]
An hour, not only a Lich.

[Speaker 3]
We're making the deck of anything

[Speaker 2]
Either die or pick a garden.

[Speaker 5]
Has anyone watched chainsaw man?

[Speaker 2]
No, no.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, I feel like this is how the the gun demon is created. Yeah. No, it's an offering and an extra dimensional void with some magic juice.

[Speaker 1]
Okay,

[Speaker 5]
You guys get, uh, a bunch of this tripol. So, are you guys trying to experiment with these Apes?

[Speaker 2]
We will get a we'll get. Will get a pile of it. Uh, we're just trying to figure out how you know. The conclusion if we can shoot magic through it? We don't need to make the monkey drink it to know that the fireball will end up inside the boat. Well,

[Speaker 3]
It we're going to know if we can drink it, right? We probably, if this is something we should drink, or we should try and clean to the spare based on how the monkey reacts.

[Speaker 2]
Let's feed a little to a monkey thing, but it feels cool. It

[Speaker 5]
Doesn't have to damage it's just.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, we feed the monkey just like a little, you know, like half a vial's worth of this.

[Speaker 5]
So, do you guys just go out and like, capture a random monkey,

[Speaker 2]
Not a random monkey. Yeah,

[Speaker 5]
Okay, so monkeys can't be racist, right?

[Speaker 2]
Huh, why not, they can, they can.

[Speaker 5]
I, I don't think they're intelligent to them.

[Speaker 2]
Monkeys have inter monkey Wars inter-clan Wars.

[Speaker 3]
I've known dogs that are racist. They bark at only like people of certain races.

[Speaker 2]
Mailmen, I've seen

[Speaker 5]
That before. Yeah, black people and stuff.

[Speaker 3]
My friend had a dog who only loved the Asian people, so it

[Speaker 4]
Was a scattered or not.

[Speaker 2]
Uh, I'm just.

[Speaker 5]
I'm just asking, are you fighting the monkeys? Are you just kidnapping? You're kidnapping. Okay, it's not an encounter. You guys don't have to like, give him stuff. Fight the monkeys later, though. You kidnap a monkey, uh, it is wildly like, you know, fighting in your grip, but, uh. Uh, you and lavender actually both like manhandle the shit out of this monkey I haven't yet, too. Yeah, having that you're immune to lightning damage? Kindling the shit out of this. Like, it's, it's like, basically, an ape with, like, white fur, and it has like these bright yellow like teeth, uh, these fangs that, like, extend past this Jaws both ways.

[Speaker 5]
Bright red eyes. Um, we

[Speaker 2]
Gotta get this over with.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, okay. So, what do you guys do?

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, we eat the monkey.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, we just feed the monkey. Okay, help down.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah,

[Speaker 3]
It was a very smart of us to bring the monkey to the triple instead of get throwing her out.

[Speaker 5]
Uh, you guys feed a triple, uh, just not fuck with it at all. Yeah, I mean, it screams in pain.

[Speaker 3]
Okay,

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, oh goodness,

[Speaker 5]
Anything. I mean, there's once it goes past its gullet, uh. Besides the fact that it seems to be in a lot of pain, uh, not that much to observe. In case I think we should look on it.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, okay, so there was. So, let's say, we also had another vial of the triple from the same vial, um. I, I shoot a can drink into. I shoot, um,

[Speaker 3]
Shoot something. Nice, wait,

[Speaker 5]
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

[Speaker 5]
I,

[Speaker 2]
I cast healing word.

[Speaker 5]
Okay, hold on. Wait, you have okay, you have two vials of this house or triple. Excuse me, you have like this triple-ish liquid. Yeah, so are you casting this? What are you doing so

[Speaker 2]
When we when we got we have? So we have these two like jars, right? Take some of it, feed half to monkey, and with the other half. I like,

[Speaker 5]
Try to cast human word into it. Okay. I'll repeat this, you know, for a fact? Have triple linked to each other. You first need to cast a spell in between both of them. Does that make sense? It's in the monkey now! You can wreck on it.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, sure, we recommend that. Um,

[Speaker 5]
Okay, we got these

[Speaker 2]
Two, do I? So how does how does it work exactly. So, if I have this bile, I want to have it. The cells be connected. Do I just cast a spell into it, and then all sorry, not all the tried pulling the violence. Now, I'm connected.

[Speaker 5]
Generally, when you're casting a spell, the process feels like you are concentrating kind of this inner energy outwards into the palm of one of your hands. You're just doing that in both, so you would consume a spell slot, but you would be casting it in between these two things. Okay,

[Speaker 2]
So, and I'm holding two vitals.

[Speaker 5]
Yes, and I am

[Speaker 2]
Casting a spell and focusing it through both of them. Yes, now they are

[Speaker 5]
Linked, yes. And,

[Speaker 2]
Uh, that can change it. That spells a lot. Yes, just level

[Speaker 5]
One. Just level one, but

[Speaker 1]
It does need to be a specific spelling. No.

[Speaker 2]
Feed. The monkey doesn't like it. I

[Speaker 5]
Don't like it.

[Speaker 2]
The monkey is taking damage, and um. Yeah, I go distance. Doorbell walks away. He has healing word onto the vial that he's holding.

[Speaker 5]
The energy that? God, I hate this. The energy that you're putting into this vial? Operates effectively, where the monkey is, and it heals him.

[Speaker 2]
Guys. Why did I think of using Fireball as poor monkey? You see, now our experiment is ethical because we've healed the acid damage. We've done this.

[Speaker 1]
We should have maybe had someone down in the big jar to see if the if your spells went there.

[Speaker 5]
Oh no, no, it doesn't. Yeah, okay.

[Speaker 2]
So, as I complete the monkeys heeled? It's still at the worst monkey in America. Okay, we can't walk back on that. What do we do? We put him down.

[Speaker 3]
Do? We could give it a fair fight, you know. Take it out of the net and then fight it all right. So,

[Speaker 2]
Monkeys restrained, uh, we draw a circle.

[Speaker 5]
In

[Speaker 2]
The circle, you got an audience and we they go at it.

[Speaker 5]
This is so much worse than just killing it.

[Speaker 5]
That's my fuck it. I'm down, I'm down. Is that a while I'm on the sideline waiting with a gun? This is this is the Cincinnati Zoo. Oh, Jesus Christ. Is that what you guys want to do? I'm down. I'm ready to roll baby.

[Speaker 5]
I mean, are you guys letting good have a 1v1 or what

[Speaker 3]
I mean?

[Speaker 5]
How is this? It is a big monkey. I feel

[Speaker 2]
Badly for laughing here. I'll get involved, uh?

[Speaker 5]
Uh, fuck, where did he go?

[Speaker 1]
Sorry, hold on.

[Speaker 3]
I was six initiative. That's with Advancement.

[Speaker 1]
Are we all fighting or is lavender?

[Speaker 3]
I'm I just wrote initiative, so if it goes bad for lavender, I will be doing it.

[Speaker 1]
That's very interesting. Poor lavender

[Speaker 3]
Is lavender okay with this?

[Speaker 2]
Lavender.

[Speaker 5]
Huh,

[Speaker 3]
You want to fight a monkey,

[Speaker 5]
Um? Well, I'm eager to prove myself in battle, but this one feels a bit mean.

[Speaker 3]
What if I tell you if you're really racist?

[Speaker 2]
He hates our kind.

[Speaker 5]
Bigger versus amazing check!

[Speaker 2]
I don't want to say

[Speaker 1]
It. I don't want to say it either fine.

[Speaker 2]
First of all, for some reason Jesus Christ. This is.

[Speaker 3]
15.

[Speaker 5]
15, he. It's a racist monkey, yes. It doesn't look like it hates us. Yeah, sure, why not?

[Speaker 3]
Oh, just because it's not racist towards you, it's okay for me race towards other things.

[Speaker 5]
How it works.

[Speaker 3]
Stop asking questions.

[Speaker 2]
Uh,

[Speaker 3]
If gladly, if you feel like you're gonna die, just tell us

[Speaker 2]
And.

[Speaker 5]
Wait, where the fuck hold on?

[Speaker 2]
Looking for lavender? No?

[Speaker 5]
The blangonga. Where the fuck did he go?

[Speaker 5]
With

[Speaker 1]
The shit.

[Speaker 3]
This also gives us a good idea of if we fight the monkeys. How scared should we be? The lavender takes this one-on-one and is easy. We like we need it 100 months.

[Speaker 2]
I think we can. I don't

[Speaker 1]
Think we'll

[Speaker 2]
Have a problem with the monkeys at this point.

[Speaker 3]
I will have a new questions and a great internet. One DND character, one for

[Speaker 5]
100 monkeys.

[Speaker 5]
Where the fuck did he go. The thing is broken. Um.

[Speaker 5]
Oh my God.

[Speaker 5]
That was my mouth.

[Speaker 5]
Sorry, just give me a second.

[Speaker 5]
Uh, documents.

[Speaker 1]
Uh.

[Speaker 1]
Jesus.

[Speaker 1]
Ah, there we go.

[Speaker 5]
Sorry guys! There we go.

[Speaker 2]
Is, this time we're gonna is this. Is this the note we're gonna end on? We're just gonna poison this monkey and then kill the rest of its family. Wait, did we already kill the monkey? No,

[Speaker 5]
No, you're about to. Alcoa is inevitable. Yeah, okay, one on one. Let's do this. I was, like, you

[Speaker 2]
Apparently just for, like. Yeah, I guess, oh yeah, right, I, I honestly. I think even Hemlock feels bad at this point.

[Speaker 5]
You guys, just poisoning this monkey. Lavender is still like wrestling it. Absolute!

[Speaker 2]
Is it still poison though?

[Speaker 3]
Then you heal the wound. You still shot him. That's true,

[Speaker 2]
But it's not nearly as bad as if you didn't

[Speaker 1]
Feel good. I think maybe we should. I don't know Meg and Robin is probably moving on from the monkey. I think

[Speaker 5]
We just

[Speaker 3]
Let the monkey let the monkey free in the. I'll also destroy everything.

[Speaker 2]
Are we still going to go fight the encounter though, because that would mean that of all of these monkeys, like freaking racist? I don't like ones that lives

[Speaker 3]
The rest die.

[Speaker 5]
You guys made up in your heads.

[Speaker 5]
Okay, okay, so first, that the second thing I wanted to mention is that, uh, for the return Voyage of this journey, because I assume that eventually will be making your way back? I wanted to propose some with you guys. You

[Speaker 1]
Guys

[Speaker 5]
Are significantly stronger now than when you started this trip for a multitude of reasons, uh? I would like to propose to you instead of the way that we did it before. You get to? My idea was, you don't get to long rest. However you get to encounter. You get to pick any of the monsters that are on these tables, uh, and then you roll a D4 to figure out how many of them you are fighting.

[Speaker 2]
I have a question

[Speaker 5]
Yes,

[Speaker 2]
Really. Should we be able to teleport back to the circle? Yes,

[Speaker 5]
You could theoretically do that as well. Okay,

[Speaker 3]
How are you doing this though?

[Speaker 2]
I do want to like, kind of, test our stream. Do you want to read more Havoc?

[Speaker 1]
We only have three months we should make. Well, I think there's some people who would be really helpful, like, are not people, monster stuff. It would be really helpful. We can do

[Speaker 5]
Like a couple things. Yeah, if if it

[Speaker 3]
Ever gets too much for us, then we could teleport back, right? Yeah,

[Speaker 1]
It's not an

[Speaker 2]
Instant type thing, but we'd have to, like, yeah,

[Speaker 3]
Like, after we beat the monster. We can just fuck up.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, maybe

[Speaker 1]
Like towards, like, I mean, I'm assuming we're doing that next session. Like, maybe we come prepared with the monster? We would like to

[Speaker 5]
Yes, yeah,

[Speaker 2]
All right rolls.

[Speaker 2]
Conscious creatures like? You know they can communicate? Okay,

[Speaker 1]
I agree. Yeah,

[Speaker 2]
Yeah,

[Speaker 5]
That sounds good

[Speaker 1]
To talk to you. We can't get on

[Speaker 2]
Okay,

[Speaker 1]
Unless they actually are threatening our lives. All

[Speaker 2]
Right, if there's a question, should have to be evil.

[Speaker 1]
Actively threatening us if they're just like passively evil. That's kind of just a personality.

[Speaker 5]
You guys just suck.

[Speaker 2]
I have a question then. Can this monkey talk no,

[Speaker 1]
Okay?

[Speaker 2]
I was just gonna say I killed a monkey.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, I mean, it's. It is like a relatively tanky motherfucker, so it takes a while, but you get there eventually. Okay, uh, it's not a fight. Um, yeah. It does eventually.

[Speaker 3]
Do we get loot for the monkey?

[Speaker 5]
No, no, no, I figured I wasn't on a counter, so I can't, like, in good conscience, to give you items for free. So, my idea was to get like. Because we haven't had a combat, uh, in, like two sessions now. And I want to like, give you guys the opportunity to test how strong you guys are now. So, no long rest, uh, you choose any of the monsters that you want to hunt, uh, but you roll, uh, D4, or a D6, depending on how easy they are. Uh, to figure out how many you get, uh, if they're hard enough, and you roll like a D4, uh, you will get all four items.

[Speaker 5]
And you can also choose to just sell them instead of like taking motion for them. You can just sell the room

[Speaker 2]
All right.

[Speaker 5]
Let's get rich instead. But that's the idea I had, uh, I'm pretty comfortable with leaving it at that here. Yeah. We can, hopefully, next time Tristan will join us. Um, but he's still moving, I don't know. We'll see what happens?

[Speaker 3]
Under the encounter tables. Yeah, I can show it on the screen.

[Speaker 2]
I think they should be pins same ones, right?

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, I think they should be pinned. Let me check.

[Speaker 2]
They are not.

[Speaker 5]
They are opened my fault. Okay, that would be great.

[Speaker 2]
You should pray for the fights. We should probably.

[Speaker 2]
This one. That one will be really good for Goldberg.

[Speaker 2]
Shit. There we go. Wow! This was an interesting session.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, yeah. It was very funny. I did not think that we would encounter fucking Beetle bear. It was terrible. Here we are.

[Speaker 2]
In there. Uh, we should have gave him a line of losellos.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, I actually

[Speaker 1]
Just make him crazy.

[Speaker 5]
I actually didn't finish the, uh, stuff for the red dragon or the red u. Part, which is where you're at right now. Uh, but this is all available.

[Speaker 2]
No, I mean.

[Speaker 5]
So, this is the zone that you were in while you traveled here. This is the bezelgies you already got the charge them all here. Uh, you also got between the other one. Isn't

[Speaker 2]
Here. It's

[Speaker 1]
Here.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, yeah. These are, these are the same. This is the same region. Oh no, okay. It's just too wides to fit on the same.

[Speaker 5]
Okay, you guys can take a look.

[Speaker 3]
We got the horn, right? Yes. Do we have a list of all the things we got,

[Speaker 5]
Uh, you guys got the horn? You got the charge Mall, uh, you got the? Don't think you got any of these? No, don't think so.

[Speaker 2]
Photo band borrow, yeah, that's the

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, yeah, that's the horn that you guys got. And then, I think you guys got the.

[Speaker 2]
Right. Yeah,

[Speaker 5]
