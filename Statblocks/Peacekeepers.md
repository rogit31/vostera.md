Peacekeepers are the main military force of the [[Academy Arcanum]]. They are highly trained spellcasters, and are often given the liberty of what kind of spellcasting or fighting style they prefer, but even the martial users are capable of casting at least a few spells. 

They are generally seen with a white cape, and a mouthless, noseless white mask in times of peace, black in times of war. There are multiple different variants of peacekeepers as outlined below.
