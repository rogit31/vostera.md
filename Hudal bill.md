Bill E90 otherwise known as the Hudal bill outlines spells that are banned from usage and enchantment to regular citizens of the [[Ashir Empire]] by [[Academy Arcanum |the Academy]]. 

# Creation
The Hudal bill was passed in ??? by the [[Hudalists]] as a new anti-aetheric measure to further protect citizens of the [[Ashir Empire]] from violent or manipulative aetheric spells. 

# Forbidden spells

- Spells of necromantic nature, or that otherwise deal with resurrection
- Spells of pyrolytic nature
- Spells of divinatory nature
- Spells of illusory nature
- Spells of charming or otherwise psychic nature
- Curses of any kind

These spells may only be used in time of war or/and by [[Peacekeepers|peacekeepers]] or other military personnel. The punishments for using these spells vary from the gravity of the spell, the intent of the spellweaver, and other mitigating and aggravating conditions surrounding the case. Both [[Peacekeepers|peacekeepers]] and [[Imperial Guards |imperial guards]] have the right to make arrests based on substantial suspicion of the use of spells under E90.
