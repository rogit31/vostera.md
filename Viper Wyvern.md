The vyper wyvern is a stalking predator that uses a powerful paralytic venom to paralyze its prey and slowly wither them down by flinging spikes from its tail at it until it bleeds out and dies. Generally solo hunters, but can be found in couples during mating season, where they become particularly aggressive.
