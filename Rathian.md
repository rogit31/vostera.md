The Rathian is a true flying wyvern similar in looks to her male counterpart, rathalos. She is a pack hunter. Her hide is a dull, muted green in contrast to the Rathalos's deep red, and her lower mandible features a long, protruding chin spike. Her upper back and wingtips are covered in a moss-like fur not seen on the rathalos, and while her clubbed tail lacks bony spikes, it makes up for
this with its ability to poison foes upon contact. Rathian, like her mate, can generate flaming projectiles from her mouth. She can use the poisonous barbs on her tail club to inflict blunt-force, toxic wounds on foes, even if her tail was cut off, suggesting that the poison-producing organ is near the base of the tail or near the flame organ. Her powerful legs allow her to run at high speeds, making her easily capable of chasing down most prey.
