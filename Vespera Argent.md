## Backstory
---

I remember the founding home in Avendor like it was yesterday. The simple wood construction, the smell of firewood constantly burning in the winter. It was simultaneously quiet and peaceful, but rowdy with the sound of the birds and my siblings. I remember my mother telling us about how this world came to be. The gods, the titans. It was a beautiful story. Her lies were the prettiest lace to be woven right before our eyes. Relatively young I could already tell something was off. Nola and me could tell. The other children believed her without a doubt in their minds, but we could tell. If we were born from the soil, from the light of Sola, where were the others? What was she hiding from us when she walked away for days at a time, making sure she wasn't followed into the woods? Where did these books, art pieces, tools come from? And who is in that small drawing in her locket that she kept so close to her chest? Questions all left unanswered by Aylin, and ignored by my siblings. By my 100th birthday, I had enough of the obscurity imposed by my mother and left. I was strong and cunning enough at that age to make it on my own, or so I thought. My first winter, I was resting in a log hut I had built over the summer on the east coast of Avendor, when I heard the familiar grunts of a bear smelling the food I had accidentally left much too near my resting place. I was prepared, and picked up my spear and a torch to fight off the intruder. 
As I carefully peeled back the leather door of my hut, I was terrified to reveal not a bear, but a small scaly winged creature on four legs looking at me straight in the eye. This is what my mother called a dragon. I dropped my torch into the mud out of shock, it extinguished immediately as the cold mud splattered on my leg. The dragon roared. Terrified, I instinctively protected my face with my arms, remembering what my mother had told me about their fire breathing. I felt the heat lick and ripple over my arms, but it didn't burn. Surprised, I opened my eyes to see that the dragon was staring at me with it's jaw fully closed. The flames where coming from my fingers. Like snakes climbing a tree, they spilled down my arms and covered my chest, looking heavy and liquid. The dragon gave me an odd look that I interpreted like surprise, or maybe shock. It slowly walked away before jumping into the sky and flying away. I remember screaming at it profanities, trying to scare it away further, making sure it wouldn't come back. I don't remember what happened after that, but I remember waking up with my face in the mud. I had cast my first spell that day.
