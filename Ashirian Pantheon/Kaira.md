Kaira is the god of commerce, trickery, mortal pleasures, comedy, riches, adventure, travel, and hedonism.

## Origin
---

The myth of Kaira's origin is one of brotherhood and meaning to life. In the face of unending torment, [[Vero]] after witnessing the truths of the universe came to the conclusion that the meaning of existence can be split into two distinct things. The first is pleasure, or hedonism. Kaira is the embodiment of such a philosophy. The second is Kaira's brother, [[Ma'at]]. 

## Philosophies
---

As such, Kaira is seen as a trickster and the embodiment of hedonism. The good things in life, or in Kaira's case, the everlasting existence of godhood, are a blessing to be enjoyed and abused freely. Gold, food, wine, lust and drugs are all part of one's natural attempt at finding meaning in a nonsensical and confusing world, and not only are they valid but they are sometimes the only thing that make sense. If they weren't meant to be enjoyed, why are they so enjoyable? 

Kaira's followers are often merchants, troubadours, cooks, jesters and sex workers. 


## Temples

Kaira's largest temple is by far [[Kaira's merchant ring]] in [[Avendor]].
