Aether is the name given to the invisible, immaterial substance that is manipulated during the casting of [[Spell|spells]]. 


# Needs to explain
- Casting of spells
- Resting somehow recharging this
- Different classes of magical sources
- being erased by the aetheric bomb then coming back
- the simpler and more unified the better
# Principles
- Aether is like a web of some kind, that happens to have different rates of 'stickability' depending on the material/person. 
- -> could explain why there are differences in between people, species, and materials
- Aether can be displaced or transformed, but not destroyed (we can excuse the bomb by saying it just displaced it, really far away from vostera)
- The casting of spells is then just the displacement of aether from the inside of the body to the outside 
- Eventually ether creeps its way back into space, in concentrations and speeds varying by the material
- problems with this theory include that this means that aether is effectively an infinite resource (which I mean, it kind of is? at least mechanically)
- This needs an explanation for why Aylin would be surprised. Aylin lived in a world far more aetherically advanced, so how would they not figure this out? Especially Aylin? What kind of mistake did she make to make the bomb ineffective in the long run. 
- The mistake she made is that she effectively poisoned the post bomb vostera with herself and her children. She failed to consider that aether is consistent across planes. By saving herself, she doomed Vostera to be poisoned by aether again. 

1. Aether can be displaced and transformed, but not destroyed.
2. Aether needs a material body to attach to. 
3. Different materials can carry varying amounts and concentrations of aether.
4. The casting of a spell is the displacement of aether from inside the body to the outside.
5. Different spells are different concentrations and manipulations of that displaced aether. 
6. With time, aether will seek homeostasis and to stick to its nearest material bodies.
