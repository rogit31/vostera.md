The last dragonrider is a rumored figure of the [[Aegurian Wildlands]]. He has supposedly been seen riding an ancient red dragon. One of the original children. A dwarf by the name of Uuno Janes. Uuno has disagreed with his sister Nola's policies ever since she took over the lead in their community. This came to a breaking point after the academy's creation, where he stole the book and hid in the Aegurian Wildlands, maintaining a veil of anti-magical stuff that prevents scrying and teleportation into a large chunk of the aegurian wildlands. He raises dragons and other monsters in that area peacefully, until his body has recently started weakening. His spell won't last much longer if he doesn't do something quick. He is on the hunt for a fresh body to pour his consciousness into. He has been raising dragons on his side of the island for centuries to defend Aegur with and stop the Ashirian Expansion. He flies over the barrier to try and find a body, but before he can, he hears a massive explosion. Right below Fool's Gold, the peacekeepers cause an extreme reaction caused by a spell detonating the aetherically charged air. The academy wins eventually, as they attempt to remove his memory. Before it completes, Uuno gets to the scene, killing the peacekeepers and kidnapping Phineas' party to use as his next own vessel. He already inhabits Phineas's vessel atm.
