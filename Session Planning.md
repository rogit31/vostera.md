# Things to think of

- How can we bring player ties back into the narrative? I.e,
- Hemlock's mother
- Meg's brother
- Bor's... horse?
- Sylril and Mila 

# Potential scenes

 - Hemlock hallucinates/dreams of the old world maybe?
 - Sylril dreams of Mila again
 - Players go to try and rescue Khava from where she is kept in the clarit hill residences, near the fancy scarab.
 - They attempt to carry her all the way to Onarx? And have the rest of the band regroup there? 
 - OR they go directly towards Aegur and the wildlands. Elwyn's teleportation circle is in the basement of an old underbelly parlor, the rusty drop. 
 - They can also attempt to steal and/or buy a scroll containing the teleport spell.
 - Spell scrolls follow this formula to determine price:$$ f\left(x\right)\ =\ \ 35\cdot\ x^{2}\ +\ 30$$
 - What awaits them in the Aegurian wildlands if they manage to go there directly, and what awaits them if they use the teleportation circle Elwyn gave them? 
 - Some outpost in the Aegurian wildlands that is basically a pokemon/monster hunter table gambling center rewarding hunters that come back with good stuff. Also life insurance to adventurers.
 - A whole ass biome
 - Random encounter table? But maybe modified to be only rewards for under a certain number to signify their current strength

## Sylril's dream

- Boiling blood pouring out of gaping wound where her right breast should be
- Left parents behind, went to Sola's church, got frustrated and abandoned them. 
- You couldn't handle a bit of bureaucracy, what makes you think you can handle me?
- Last time, I asked you what you are living for. But maybe I asked you the wrong question, for I do not care whether you live or die. What are you willing to bleed for?

# Larger unanswered questions

- What do Vespera and Zeke know about Aylin's history, the old world and the current one?
- Based on what they know, what do they plan to do about it? 
- Who in general knows about the old world? 
- Who knows about Aylin's secret?
- Who knows the academy's actual goals? 

# TODO
- Go into more detail about the Aylin's children's upbringing, I think this will unlock a lot of the story paths for Zeke and Vespera. 
- Also, realistically over 800 years what would've the two immortal children have done.
- Rethink the pheonixgate thing. 
- Lucius's green liquid stat sheet
- Lucina's statsheet
