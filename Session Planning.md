## Hemlock's dream 
 - EYE
 - Flapping of flags, dry cold imari wind. The sound of a leather tent opening and closing. 
 - A familiar elven face with gray hair walks through 
 - There's a silence as the other sergeants in the tent cut the small talk
 - 
"I have been told the Imari forces have started digging into their trenches and reinforced their position over the hilly southern side of Ardora's Tower. Their height advantage proximity to fort goria has made it difficult for us to advance any further into their territory without losing a significant amount of men. I understand you have been here for 3 months and that morale is starting to crumble. I am here to move things along. My approach will ne significantly more swift than Lieutenant Vixal's. Ardora's tower has been a significant thorn in your sides, with spellcasters holed into a protected tower with full field of view of our approaches. The spellcasters you had besides you" - as she points to some peacekeepers with a black mask instead of their usual white one. "Are still a bit inexperienced in their combat tactics, and I am here to assure you that this is going to change. We are going to coordinate a mounted attack onto Ardora's tower using a new spell I have devised. This spell is powerful, and will neutralize the vast majority of spellcasters present in the tower. It will cast a blanket of silence and of aetheric darkness over the tower, making it impossible for inexperienced spellcasters to cast any spells, and the darkess will provide cover for our squads to close the distance without taking too many casualties. However, this spell requires multiple of my troops to concentrate on it constantly. This means we will need the bodies of the empire corps to cover for the academy corps. " The sound of the tent flap rolling with the wind is deafening as the air becomes heavy. "I know that some of you are distrustful of the academy corps, Many of you have seen firsthand your comrades perish to the hands of spellcasters. Many of you do not fully understand aether, how it is manipulated and processed to cast spells. It is a complex and secretive art. However the academy corps and peacekeepers are your fellow Ashirians. They wish for you and your comrades to survive just as much as you do. I am personally working on thinning the line in between the two corps, and this mission will be the first of its kind with full cooperation in between both. We will be assigning a peacekeeper to every squadron in this operation." Murmurs take over the tent. "If this operation is a success, the chances of further cooperation are high. The idea behind this operation is simple. Platoons one and three will be mounting a frontal assault on the tower's east and west side respectively They will each be escorting a spellcasting peacekeeper who will be concentrating on this new spell. This while provide cover to  squads Hemlock, Danso and Addai, who once the spell covers the tower, will be charged with infiltrating the tower and neutralizing all threats within. "

# Larger unanswered questions

- What do Vespera and Zeke know about Aylin's history, the old world and the current one?
- Based on what they know, what do they plan to do about it? 
- Who in general knows about the old world? 
- Who knows about Aylin's secret?
- Who knows the academy's actual goals? 

# TODO

- ring of elemental resistance
- Bitey companion page
- Green dragon sac powder
- Go into more detail about the Aylin's children's upbringing, I think this will unlock a lot of the story paths for Zeke and Vespera. 
- Finish the playlists, add theme songs for vespera, the order, maybe some others.
- Make some weathered paper and write a letter from Meg's brother magnus
- Buy a better marker and try map-fuing 
- Also, realistically over 800 years what would've the two immortal children have done.
- Rethink the pheonixgate thing. 
- Lucina's statsheet
- Vixal's statsheet
- Complete article about aether
- Green goblin waiting for them at the Last Respite, multicolor armor, metal opening/voice 

# Remember
- Highlight the interactibles (3 things)
