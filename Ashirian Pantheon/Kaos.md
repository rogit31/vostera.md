Kaos is the primordial god of existence, the cosmos, eternity and uncertainty. As the first and only thing to exist before time itself, he created the cosmos as we know it. To fill the void, he created the universe and the stars. Nowadays represented by a simple circle, Kaos as a primordial god is known by all but followed by a few cultists.

## Philosophies
---

Kaos' philosophies are generally pretty sparse. Scholars across the [[Ashir Empire]] have attempted to collect as much evidence and history relating to his worship, but have generally failed to do so in any meaningful way. He is most commonly seen as the grand creator, an architect, and as such can sometimes be seen to be worshipped by individuals who place high value in creation and time, for one reason or another. 

His cult is still quite sparse though in comparison to the other deities of the Ashirian pantheon.
