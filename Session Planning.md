## Empire POV
Vespera knows the tome of civilization is there and in the hands of the dragonrider (most likely her brother)
- She sends academy troops to look for it. 
- They presumably don't know anything else about it. 
- Some academy troops were previously sent to deal with Phineas and his research. 
- They tracked and found the party, had a fight with them, which would have ended in an at least partial academy victory since Phineas's party didn't come back. 
- When they fought, they left behind traces of a fight. Phineas' party fought valiantly, but lost eventually. Uuno interrupts, killing the peacekeepers and kidnapping Phineas' party. He currently inhabits Phineas's body.

# Remember

## Larger unanswered questions

- What do Vespera and Zeke know about Aylin's history, the old world and the current one?
- Based on what they know, what do they plan to do about it? 
- Who in general knows about the old world? 
- Who knows about Aylin's secret?
- Who knows the academy's actual goals?
