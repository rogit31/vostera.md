During the **Titanic Age**, Vostera was dominated by colossal beings called **Titans**. These Titans were made of aetheric minerals, and were covered in natural elements like rocks, trees, bushes, moss and grass. They roamed the land, shaping the very landscape with their immense power. Mountains rose, canyons formed, oceans swelled, and volcanoes erupted with each step they took. These Titans were not fully conscious but had an instinctive desire to absorb the radiant light of **Sola**, the Sunmother. They were incapable of communicating or reproducing and engaged in endless battles over Sola's light, known as the **Titanic Wars**. These conflicts were devastating, capable of demolishing mountains and emptying oceans.

During this time, **humanoid inhabitants existed on Vostera and revered the Titans as living embodiments of cosmic forces**. Life on Vostera flourished in harmony with the Titans, and the people had **no need for gods or deities**.

As time passed, **Vostera's humanoid civilizations developed impressive technological advancements**. They learned to **harness the abundant magical energy emanating from the Titans**, creating machines, devices, and spells that greatly improved their quality of life. **Titans were revered as a source of limitless power**, and people relied on aether and magic rather than prayers or divine intervention. This suggests a society where arcane technology was integrated into daily life.

However, this era of progress led to the **Captivity of Titans**. Driven by a thirst for power and technological advancement, several capital cities sought to **control and harness the Titans' energy on a grander scale**. Political entities captured and subdued these primordial beings, exploiting their natural weaknesses to **power cities, machines, and weapons**. The public perception of this captivity relied heavily on the belief that Titans were mindless beings.

This perception was challenged by the discovery of **Roshan Hunfrid**, a researcher on titan biology, who found that **Titans were capable of feeling pain, pleasure, resentment, and desire**. His research threatened the stability of the Titans' captivity, leading to pressure for him to keep his findings secret, and ultimately his murder and the destruction of his research.

His wife, **Aylin Ashir (the Planewalker)**, was a researcher in **Aetherology**, the study of materials interacting with magic. Horrified by the exploitation of the Titans and driven by the desire to protect them after her husband's death, she **fast-forwarded her research and discovered the potential to create a powerful anti-magic bomb using refined aetherates**, materials derived from the Titans. Aylin resolved that the only solution was to start anew, without aether.

This sets the stage for the cataclysm, **Titanfall**, where Aylin detonated her anti-magic bomb, leading to the collapse of this technologically and magically advanced world.

In summary, the world before Titanfall was characterized by:

- **Dominance of colossal, semi-sentient beings called Titans** who shaped the physical world and were the primary source of magical energy.
- **Absence of widespread god worship**, with humanoids relying on the power derived from Titans.
- **Highly advanced technological civilizations** that harnessed the magic of the Titans for various purposes.
- **Exploitation and captivity of Titans** for their immense power.
- **Growing ethical concerns** about the treatment of Titans, which were ultimately suppressed.
- A world on the brink of destruction due to its reliance on and exploitation of aether and the Titans, culminating in a cataclysmic event intended to eliminate magic.
