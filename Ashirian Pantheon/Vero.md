Vero, The Damned, is the deity of knowledge, omniscience, truth, and madness.

## Origin
---

Vero was born at the same time as [[Sola]] from [[Kaos]]. To fill the void of his fathers creation, as opposed to Sola, Vero sought the truth. In the belief of an objective truth and deeper meaning to the universe, Vero was driven mad by a search for meaning. Despite his unfathomable intelligence and depth of knowledge he could not see past his own quest and became mad. Despite this, he helped Sola in creating life on Vostera by gifting them the curse of knowledge, but hoped that through communication, speech, and myth the beings of Vostera would be able to find meaning and content in Vostera where he could not.

## Relations
---

It is said that in Vero's madness, cursed with the knowledge of the universe, he created his sons in an attempt to understand the world around him and alleviate his curse. [[Ma'at]] and his brother [[Kaira]] were born.

## Appearance
---

Vero effectively looks like a darker, larger, spookier version of Vel'koz from League of Legends. The rest is up to your imagination.

## Cult
---

Vero's cult is prophetic in nature. After years of training, many of Vero's priests become [[Truthseekers]], a special kind of priest that has developed a literal third eye in the middle of their forehead. This grants them the ability to see truthfully, to share information with other truthseekers, but removes their ability to lie. 

As truthseekers, they may still keep their every day life as is, or become a working member of the church. Many truthseekers chose the first option, and in many cases that may help them with their professions, academics, doctors, and many other knowledge based professions enjoy the benefits of magically empowered sight and a shareable web of information well. 

The ones who do chose to become working members of the church generally do so with the objectives of helping others, including other priests of the church and fellow Vosterians. It is said that after much training, truthseekers also develop special powers including premonition, telepathy and telekinesis.

## Philosophy
---

Vero's philosophy is one of absolute truth, and he believes that knowledge should be pursued at any cost, regardless of the consequences. He is willing to share his knowledge with those who prove themselves worthy, but his gifts often come at a terrible price. To seek Vero's knowledge is to risk madness and damnation, for the truths he holds are not meant for mortal minds to comprehend.
