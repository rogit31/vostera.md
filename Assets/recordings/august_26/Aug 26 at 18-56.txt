[Speaker 1]
No, no, it's all good. I'm just leading down. It's kind of awkward.

[Speaker 1]
You okay?

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, that's good, probably. I didn't. Honestly, probably one of my favorite sessions that we had. That's fucking crazy. Great.

[Speaker 3]
I think, of course, the door sessions.

[Speaker 2]
Seems like characters dying, uh, having an impact. I don't like that. No, I think maybe we should do it more, you know, my, my deepest memory of playing DND with you guys is my last part with that.

[Speaker 2]
So, do you guys, uh, come around the campfire? Phineas. And. Literally for 100 character names. It's been that long. Uh, bag, several kite. Hemlock. And Phineas, uh, you find yourselves around the campfire once again discussing your future plans. Um, you gave India's The Rundown of kind of what's happening. What's going on? He starts explaining to you what he went through. And. He goes. Well, I mean the entire time we were just looking for a solution to what this place was and why these monsters here exist in the first place. I mean, aeger is not that far. And yet, we don't have any of those kinds of monsters back home.

[Speaker 2]
But I mean, now, especially with these notes, and he shows the notes. Adorable dog, he says. I think we can probably piece it together and find some kind of. Yeah, an even better solution for this probably.

[Speaker 3]
Um.

[Speaker 2]
So? What are your plans from now? I mean. No, I, I. I'm reunited with you, but all of you. I don't know what specifically you were here to do.

[Speaker 1]
What are our accounts?

[Speaker 2]
I need to check my memory. Um.

[Speaker 2]
I thought we set our sights into the Sugar Valley last time. Or, I think we kind of just.

[Speaker 1]
They didn't make a lot of plants in the very last yeah. Um,

[Speaker 4]
It's adorable. Dawn is still alive. What is that?

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, so normal dumb is currently, uh, maybe a vegetable.

[Speaker 1]
A

[Speaker 2]
Baby vegetable, a baby vegetable.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, yes, he

[Speaker 2]
Is currently sleeping, uh, but he is effectively. I'm not gonna role play on baby. Yeah.

[Speaker 2]
But you can imagine what it's like severely mentally deficient old person. Shall we set them up somewhere actually? Is there somewhere safe we? You know?

[Speaker 4]
Okay, where are we on the map we

[Speaker 2]
Are? We're in. We're in here

[Speaker 1]
Exactly where we stopped.

[Speaker 4]
Do we have anything? Yeah. Okay,

[Speaker 3]
It was adorable, though.

[Speaker 2]
It was adorable, though, actually, yeah,

[Speaker 3]
Oh, that was actually a big farmer strategy. We were like, it doesn't matter if we get, or if

[Speaker 2]
We get to California, that's right. I completely forgot about that, but isn't there a teleportation Circle?

[Speaker 1]
Right, right? Um, Havelock puts

[Speaker 2]
His finger on his nose. I'm not cleaning his shed.

[Speaker 3]
I will do that.

[Speaker 4]
It's.

[Speaker 3]
You need a sacrifice that will make my sacrifices. I

[Speaker 2]
Think we should find some sort of Nursery.

[Speaker 3]
Do we have any friends? Like, outside of this party that you can leave him with.

[Speaker 1]
Um, yes, we. What was that place again? Let me open the map.

[Speaker 4]
The teleport Circle back at the last Sprite goes to where?

[Speaker 1]
More humidifier, which is the best Spirit land. Maybe that'd be bad again.

[Speaker 3]
I don't feel like Blaster Spike is a good place for a elderly baby.

[Speaker 4]
I mean, the telephone circle that we don't mean to operate. Is there

[Speaker 1]
It might take us off of this island?

[Speaker 1]
That place is called Baby

[Speaker 3]
Blue. I thought if there's not a nursery in baby blue, I'll be shop. How do I know about baby blue reminder? I am native to,

[Speaker 2]
Yes, yes, uh, you know, for a fact that there is no Nursery?

[Speaker 2]
Cereal gets up in the campfire, go away and be. Like, well, guys, you know? I'm I'm very sad about Dumbledome as well. But I'm sure some ale. Would help. Tamar modes a little bit. Here I have.

[Speaker 2]
Strong beer from the?

[Speaker 4]
Uh,

[Speaker 2]
The far away lands of Vancouver Island. Amazing. Would anyone like it? Oh, it's a hazy.

[Speaker 1]
You have two kinds, so roll.

[Speaker 2]
I can do Phineas drops up and says,

[Speaker 1]
Oh my goodness,

[Speaker 2]
Oh my, gosh, oh my God, name, doctor the, the Fearsome beast white claw that is fantastic. Do you have anything that's produced with apples by any chance? I unfortunately do not, I say, spoil in my back very easily, kick away off. Which is a sugar-free 7Up or neutral light, which is a two and a half percent, but it's a pineapple orange, which is really

[Speaker 1]
Delicious. You know, our coasters money? Somewhere in there.

[Speaker 2]
Then he has to drink somebody out. Yeah,

[Speaker 3]
I don't think Venus has ever had alcohol in his place. It's probably

[Speaker 2]
Oh, really. The first time is his first ale. He goes. I feel like this is a thing that we could. Rejoice!

[Speaker 3]
Seems like improves in bad taste.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah,

[Speaker 2]
Oh yeah. You're right, he puts down the ale. Oh, very nice. Uh, middle. I'm going to keep thinking, but

[Speaker 1]
I think normal, though, would have wanted us to celebrate, I think so.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, yeah, it's an

[Speaker 2]
Adorable diamond lavender.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah,

[Speaker 2]
Adorable domain lavender, and, uh, golf.

[Speaker 1]
I don't know, I guess so. Okay,

[Speaker 4]
She would.

[Speaker 2]
She probably would,

[Speaker 1]
Yeah.

[Speaker 4]
Plus, she does.

[Speaker 2]
Anyway. Back. Back to this conundrum.

[Speaker 4]
Well, first, we need to at least get through the wild. Where

[Speaker 2]
Are we put? You guys are not that far in, um? Because I mean, you guys have left on his gold. Yeah, hunted like a few monsters, but I'll say at this point you're probably around here. Yeah, and we've hunted everything we want to hunt, right? And I think we're we're good on gear and everything.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, we can't long grass, right?

[Speaker 2]
That's correct. That's one of the things I impose on you coming back here because you guys are significantly stronger. Rest in really short rest from here on out until you reach the last respect. Relax your sight. And, uh, we could take one of the easier monsters,

[Speaker 3]
Maybe, but?

[Speaker 2]
I'm at. I'm at 51 hit points. I don't even know what I'm out. All right,

[Speaker 3]
I'll wait a few, and I'm pretty sure I use all my.

[Speaker 1]
All my spells are used up. Yeah,

[Speaker 2]
Let's. Let's get the hell back to relax this fight. Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
Okay,

[Speaker 2]
I mean. Uh, we can just kind of walk through it, uh. I already mentioned that this was kind of more of a formality rather than anything else. It was more of an opportunity for you guys to seek out more link if you want to. You guys travel along? The wide lands without much difficulty. Now, with the extra help of Phineas who also knows the lands.

[Speaker 5]
As

[Speaker 2]
Well as unfortunately extra gear. It doesn't take long for you to reach very close to the last respite, and we're just driving down along by the gun, I guess, exactly. He's not a very heavy guy, no? Um, in the meantime, there are a few conversations with Phineas. As he's kind of like putting together these notes. And he goes.

[Speaker 5]
So, how much,

[Speaker 2]
Um? I feel like I'm piecing things together, but did you guys notice anything about the? The lens here. And do you know what this note means, and he, uh, shows you a note, uh, that specifically seems to mention something about? In durable dumps, like extremely scribly and dirty rioting about how the the magic, uh, in this place, seems to be more plugins and something about the color green and something about, like, picking out all right, guys. The lasellos from the land, yeah, we've, uh. Them's, right? I mean, doorbellum was writing things down that we, we encountered along the way. We, we discovered that in the land, there was some sort of.

[Speaker 2]
How do you describe it?

[Speaker 1]
Right, what a, what

[Speaker 2]
Rock?

[Speaker 2]
To the point where it was overflowing, like it was all the river is full of it.

[Speaker 3]
Do we have any of the cocaine that we can give him?

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, I think I'll

[Speaker 3]
I'll give them a line of cocaine. Like, try this. As a good big sister would do, you can

[Speaker 2]
Try us and like, inhale it, or

[Speaker 4]
Yeah,

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, inhale it. Put one, are you sure?

[Speaker 1]
Do you have any cool spells?

[Speaker 3]
I'm, I learned a new one recently.

[Speaker 2]
Um, are you sure

[Speaker 3]
Maybe favor of a basic spell? Okay,

[Speaker 1]
Spell like a

[Speaker 2]
Pretty spell? Yeah, yeah.

[Speaker 6]
Okay, sure. Are you sure this is safe?

[Speaker 1]
Why are you talking about

[Speaker 2]
How you have in mind? I'm sorry, why don't you tell us what spell you have in mind? How about an illusion spell?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, yeah,

[Speaker 2]
No,

[Speaker 1]
Why?

[Speaker 3]
What if the illusion spells? No, we get like, actually, real when you can.

[Speaker 2]
That would be such a good awesome. That'd be so good. Okay, depends what he's what finances then. Okay, all right, I don't know. I don't know what this is.

[Speaker 3]
What illusion are you gonna do?

[Speaker 1]
Would have on

[Speaker 2]
Phineas. My name is.

[Speaker 4]
Just do just do half of it, then just half.

[Speaker 2]
I feel like I'm being pure push. Okay, okay, fine. Uh, he puts a little other stuff. I kind of looks the word you very hesitively. He's clearly like. It's already like a very kind of safe and very considerate person. He doesn't take many risks. But this peer pressure is getting to him. Well, it's not a doubt.

[Speaker 2]
Cast the spell. Some is, like, this illusion of one of the? Bambaros that you bought earlier? Um,

[Speaker 3]
I hope it doesn't become real.

[Speaker 2]
You know for a fact that the spell that he has at least would be the most archantically proficient. View. I guess it would be a Meg, probably for Arcana. Yeah, like this, this side, who knows the most about magic at this point. I feel like it's the either one of the two of you. Many, many Euras. Studying the ancient box, ancient texts in the church. You recognize as well as minor illusion. It operates as something a little bit bigger than a Meyer illusion. Um, it's definitely like much larger in size, right? I believe there's some limitations on my religion. I've already covered by

[Speaker 3]
My heart,

[Speaker 2]
But it basically breaks those limitations, at least to something thinner. It becomes bigger. It becomes more believable, uh? Goes. Well, that's definitely. I was thinking of a much smaller scale, so this seems to work larger. Is that kind of the intended effect. No, that is, I mean, that's going beyond. Oh, I guess, that, is,

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, wait, sorry. What is the, what is?

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, kind of, just like, walk up, waving my arms inside of it.

[Speaker 2]
Locals and everything, but obviously it's non material. Uh, he goes. I was trying to do like a small thing, so I guess it amplifies and does this thing for all of the spells or all these sub spells. I believe all of them and

[Speaker 4]
Everyone. That

[Speaker 2]
Way, I'm trying all spells somewhere in between EJ starts, he hits some

[Speaker 3]
Fire one time.

[Speaker 4]
It was kind of Fireball over and over and over again. So, I see

[Speaker 2]
If he has an obsession at that age.

[Speaker 2]
Right, it's his first word. No, we're not giving Norwood on life. I hate it.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, but then killing a baby is horrible. We have to leave him.

[Speaker 2]
Um, anyways. He looks at the notes he goes through. In fact, there is a lot of stuff related to Fireball. He seems like see a lot of matters, and he mentions in the environment a lot. Time. The next day, he kind of comes back with the notes, and he starts explaining he goes.

[Speaker 1]
Well, I think it

[Speaker 2]
Was. You mentioned what the notes of? That he's left behind. It does seem like there is an influx of this Los cellos. And pouring into the wildlands. And that's why there's like such a, an increased concentration of this thing so? The Titan that you found on this island was not made of the same material. Is that correct? The time. Or it was,

[Speaker 1]
It was green, right? Basically, oh, it was

[Speaker 2]
Great.

[Speaker 3]
I think he just had the stuff going into his things.

[Speaker 1]
I remember it was a big green giant,

[Speaker 4]
Right? It

[Speaker 1]
Was green. It

[Speaker 2]
Was a great night. Okay. So, it's the same material. And at the same time. It's probably coming from somewhere else, so maybe that kind of combination of concentration of the cells is what's making this place so special? Go Theory.

[Speaker 1]
I think it's so sad that

[Speaker 3]
He died that doorbellum died right before Phineas got here because they would have gone along so. Well, yeah,

[Speaker 2]
I know.

[Speaker 2]
And I'm here, um. And he's left behind. Most of what he's thought since he couldn't remember much. I guess that's probably why? Yes, that's, that's fine. Yeah.

[Speaker 3]
That's true. We have, like every single thought, he's basically ever had since he met us. It'll be, uh, it'll take me some time to

[Speaker 2]
Decide for everything, but if it makes sense so far, as far as I can understand in my conjecture, is that this? There's probably an even more or less amount of. Um. Ether across? Uh, lustera, but significantly increased here. And that's why we see these creatures who seem to. Be significantly larger and be able to cast Magic by by themselves. These effects that you guys have from your weapons, even, and he points towards your Lance. Are basically permanent enchantments. Those are the same enchantments that. Some of you have, for example, your sword, yeah, except it's made naturally. It's not someone who's infused it. It's over time. Some of these monsters or animals have specialized in this, and that's how they've survived. It's like.

[Speaker 2]
An accelerated way of improving themselves. Something like that? Do we intend on staying on this island to reach some sort of conclusion? With the scientific discovery or? Uh,

[Speaker 5]
What do we do? What should we do with this information? We have pennies.

[Speaker 2]
Here was obviously extremely bright.

[Speaker 3]
Think we're pressed for timer because we are as Fair. Will do something. Yeah.

[Speaker 2]
Pull up the world or something. So, so Phineas, I'm sorry, but I don't know what we can do about it. Oh no, I don't necessarily expect anything to be done about it, but you think it's fascinating that it exists. True enough, I'll

[Speaker 1]
We'll be here for a few more days, so. Do you have? Well, a few more days to figure out what you want to ask us.

[Speaker 2]
What did you guys do with the kitchen?

[Speaker 2]
Didn't you guys munch, like, like Smashing buttons?

[Speaker 4]
We unhooked it and then open the roof. I loved it that way.

[Speaker 1]
No, I think we hooked it in, and like we started. Charging it. Or something. Yeah, but

[Speaker 2]
At the end of the day, you unplugged it and left it there. And, oh, did we?

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, they didn't sabotaged it. I think,

[Speaker 2]
Yeah,

[Speaker 4]
Fingers crossed always.

[Speaker 1]
Walks around.

[Speaker 2]
Uh, Phineas goes well, it walking around would be. Interesting, I mean. We know from the descriptions of that. Uh, durable dumbass, and he points like gerbalone, coffee kind of the the drawings that were in the the laboratory of like the Titan and the fumors kind of work together, he goes well, you know what? At some point, they cooperated, but how well they cooperate or how? Way for the stimulus. We don't really know, do we?

[Speaker 1]
Know how much he wants to cooperate after being. Locked up there for years. How long that's

[Speaker 2]
A great point? Um, well, but we can only just hope that it stays there because I, I don't think we have any ways to help it.

[Speaker 1]
Not our problem

[Speaker 4]
Good? Yeah.

[Speaker 3]
I think it's like far away from experiment.

[Speaker 2]
I feel like we

[Speaker 1]
Was going to come.

[Speaker 4]
No, she wasn't, she's gonna come back.

[Speaker 2]
Um. Anyways, uh, he goes well. I'll try and look into it a little bit more. Maybe if there's ways of stopping it if it really goes bad?

[Speaker 4]
I think it's worth seeing what happens. You know, scientific and Discovery?

[Speaker 2]
I think it's kind of scientific discovery is free and all, but if it murders everything on this island, it is really worth it. That's why you're the scientist, not us. Those are good questions to ask, yeah. It's a rhetorical question.

[Speaker 1]
Why are you so interested in this stuff anyways?

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, what poins you?

[Speaker 1]
Can I make a perception check on what

[Speaker 2]
Their funniest has ulterior motives? He just came to life.

[Speaker 3]
He was also attacked by the Spares people. He was

[Speaker 2]
Glenn, you know that person? I wrote a 21, put it on.

[Speaker 2]
You know for a fact that he is? Purely interested in it for the interest of it itself. Well, it doesn't have any wheelchair motives he genuinely finds. This stuff fascinating and is willing to die for his world.

[Speaker 3]
This is my

[Speaker 2]
Brothers. I check whether I loaded inside check.

[Speaker 5]
If you're all higher than 21, then you know,

[Speaker 2]
All right. No, no, make a reception check. Oh.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, all right, you are warlock, after all flat rolls.

[Speaker 3]
14. Here.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, he he seems to be really interested in it for the fact he goes. Well, I mean. I don't know. I find it fascinating that this place out of everywhere else is is so different from it. Wasn't that crazy? Oh, truly. I mean. Where else have you seen animals that are able to? Free fire, and besides dragons, I guess. Friends in the same thing, I mean, but really, something down. Yeah, coming from me, I I grew up. I spent most of my years in a tiny corner of the Empire and just a little bit of travel has expanded my Horizons so much.

[Speaker 3]
It's wonderful. Who knows what's out

[Speaker 2]
There?

[Speaker 1]
There are dragons in in a share. Or the lrn. Whatever, oh yeah, the issue Empire, not as many, but they're there. You guys also let me know

[Speaker 2]
The like, the um. There are other species of kind of these large. Animals that are probably not possible without ether

[Speaker 3]
EBay. Yeah, so I wonder.

[Speaker 2]
Others to correlate. Is it just a matter of statistics or? Exposure he doesn't know he doesn't have necessarily after everything, but he was talking about it. Why don't we keep that in mind when we approach? Um, that's better, you know, cuz? This is by far the the most single source of power.

[Speaker 3]
And

[Speaker 2]
We actually so far have not linked the Sparrow. At this at all. So potentially to, you know, eventually get strong enough to beat her. Maybe we do need to harness this, so I think eventually we have to revisit this place anyway. Maybe a few days to figure out what we want to do and where we want to go.

[Speaker 1]
But perhaps we could take some lacellos, right? Yeah, sure, some would sell us, yeah.

[Speaker 2]
Present on your way. You can take time to gather as much results as you need. I'll say you get like a nice Jar full of fellows. Wow! A couple

[Speaker 5]
Of sellers pad here, uh. Either

[Speaker 2]
Of you can write that down in your inventories.

[Speaker 2]
Speaking of next steps. Sorry, I have a short memory. What are? What are our options? Well, we haven't really. Where are we at with us? Was Miss Farah?

[Speaker 1]
Um. I don't think we have figured out. A way to deal with her yet okay, but

[Speaker 2]
She knows we're here. Yes, she knows we're here, and she knows we're openly hogging against her. Yes.

[Speaker 3]
Out.

[Speaker 1]
I know Meg was working on some kind of device to tamper with her with her magic. Yeah, he gloves

[Speaker 4]
Found out that won't work. Yeah,

[Speaker 2]
Okay,

[Speaker 4]
It was the previous. She's like Beyond.

[Speaker 1]
Controllers,

[Speaker 2]
So that's where we're at with the Sparrow. Wherever your hand goes.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah,

[Speaker 2]
The she can cast spells out of other places than there is. Okay, and then he sneezes spell. Firearms.

[Speaker 4]
And then, uh, Bruno said, we could just like, die, and wait a thousand years because he was a backup plan.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, there's the dragons. Yeah, we've been long dead.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, we just live our lives. Well, you and me can't, but?

[Speaker 1]
Do that.

[Speaker 2]
I'll probably die here.

[Speaker 4]
We have to try and kill her eventually

[Speaker 2]
Now within our lifetimes.

[Speaker 1]
There's a few things yes, um. Open to hearing suggestions. Was there? Well, we have more information than we did before. We know who is behind the Wardrobe of black Sun?

[Speaker 4]
Yeah,

[Speaker 2]
Right. Zika Shear, who is?

[Speaker 1]
Oh

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, okay, I

[Speaker 1]
Saw him, I think, but for a brief moment. Uh, he was large. These disgusting looking. It looked like patches of Flesh put together. Oh, I, I'm not sure exactly what I saw, but? He was. Terrifying. Um. And, I guess, seeing that I understand how he has survived this long.

[Speaker 2]
And what would be the benefit of bringing down the order of the black Sun? Pardon me, I'm not.

[Speaker 1]
I'm not saying we've got to bring them down. I'm just saying, we know who he is, right?

[Speaker 4]
If he and Uno know some kind of like mortality stuff like, both of them seem to be messing with. That might be nice to learn more about that kind of magic just in case Vespara is also playing.

[Speaker 2]
It's true,

[Speaker 1]
But what I'm confused about is? The person behind the order of the black sun is zika Shear. But he is going against the Shirian Empire. Do the Asurions know that it's Zeke behind? Why is he? Why is vespara out in the open and Zeke is in the shadows? How did how? How did that happen?

[Speaker 2]
Okay,

[Speaker 3]
Is the emperor? Little kid is he, like a descendants of Zeke or something?

[Speaker 1]
No, he's from a different family, right? The one of the oodles or whatever I?

[Speaker 2]
Uh, differentiality. The Asurions in your group, which is. Know for a fact that there was any change in power about 200 years ago. Um, where the Asurions, who were the family that led the Empire for 600 years, were replaced by this new family called the Kudos? Dolls.

[Speaker 2]
And what's avoiding us in either Titanfall or their Sure Valley? Well. There is

[Speaker 1]
Triple in Titanfall,

[Speaker 4]
He's tightened it. Well, maybe maybe?

[Speaker 4]
Because we could get that one standing again.

[Speaker 3]
Sarah,

[Speaker 4]
But it makes us sick. So, it's

[Speaker 2]
Crazy.

[Speaker 3]
Is there a Titan winter somewhere? Oh,

[Speaker 4]
Unless we forget about some kind of magic

[Speaker 2]
Detection. I don't think we'd have

[Speaker 4]
A fun time at Nightfall.

[Speaker 1]
Do you remember that big tent? Yeah, I saw in Titanfall.

[Speaker 2]
Perhaps

[Speaker 1]
It was under the tent was similar to what we saw?

[Speaker 4]
I would love if we could just wake up all up and they could just stomp around.

[Speaker 2]
And what about the assure Valley? Whatever, what can we do there?

[Speaker 4]
You can try to figure out their birthplace. Maybe there's some information about? Plain Walker and siblings.

[Speaker 3]
So, what are our big threats like? What are we trying to avoid? Like, what

[Speaker 1]
Is the spirit doing right now? Yeah, right.

[Speaker 3]
What

[Speaker 2]
Is

[Speaker 3]
Zane doing right now?

[Speaker 2]
Yeah,

[Speaker 3]
Which of those is a more immediate concern?

[Speaker 2]
I mean, most pharaoh's always there. She can vape for us at any moment right now. If she wanted to, she can just teleport right in front of us, kill us all. Why not, right? But until we can challenge her directly, we just have to keep going.

[Speaker 3]
So,

[Speaker 2]
I say, maybe figure out what Zane's doing?

[Speaker 2]
And, and maybe find out more about that mortality, measure that that was

[Speaker 1]
Curious about, and I think for the first time in quite a while, we. What's wrong, where? Yeah, and we're not being chased by anything.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, we have some

[Speaker 1]
Time and some space to move.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, the only the only annoying part is, we don't. We can't teleport. Yeah, so we have to look at a geographically, too. After we get off the gurian widelands. We actually have to ex like they're completely unexplored agar mainland. Well, we can make it back

[Speaker 1]
To avendor. The same way we got here. Salvador, yeah, he was a teleportation Circle.

[Speaker 2]
We happened

[Speaker 3]
To to check, because if this is true, then we've kind of been stupid little time. This Phineas, no, any teleportation songs that's

[Speaker 2]
Not a proficient to know which? With enough training, maybe he could.

[Speaker 1]
Hey.

[Speaker 3]
Can he be like a NPC like lavender was for me?

[Speaker 2]
How talented of an

[Speaker 3]
Arcade stand for you?

[Speaker 2]
Well, I am the order of the black son that they train you well. Listen to me, oh my God,

[Speaker 4]
I was, like, that's a great gotcha,

[Speaker 1]
Oops! Um, no,

[Speaker 2]
I was a relatively proficient Caster. I mean, nothing special, to be honest, but I was more interested in the. The natural science of it all, but I didn't do some little stuff. Well, you're from the wildlands. What's the

[Speaker 1]
Biggest thing you've slain?

[Speaker 2]
The biggest thing? Well, now it's, I think it's with you guys, the ringbaros. Um, but I think we're

[Speaker 3]
The forehand.

[Speaker 2]
That's right. Uh, he goes well with my last party. I believe it was. Maybe a waterfox winner? I think we killed one of those. Those weren't too bad. Ever seen one of those before? Okay,

[Speaker 1]
That's awful. Guy hi,

[Speaker 2]
Fuck

[Speaker 3]
That. Weapon, even though I asked for a piercing one.

[Speaker 6]
Okay,

[Speaker 2]
So our options are numerous guys. One question I have about this whole situation is, do you? Um, do any of, you know? The spirit knows that she's failed. Yes. Has the information made it back to her yet,

[Speaker 1]
Um? I open my arm. And I was, like, do a 360. Do I see a snake? Did

[Speaker 2]
You really see a snake?

[Speaker 1]
Well, I think maybe not yet.

[Speaker 2]
Because that's probably good news for you. How

[Speaker 3]
Long do you think it would take a notice? That the guys that were supposed to do that haven't gotten back there yet.

[Speaker 2]
She's pretty fast about this at

[Speaker 3]
This ending. Still, really, she she

[Speaker 1]
Didn't have one though, right? Either way, I don't think she was after us when she came here. She was after the Book of Genesis. See,

[Speaker 2]
Actually, just to make us there. She actually had no clue that you guys were here. Yeah, uh, until eventually she did. Uh, you guys

[Speaker 1]
Met to the guys, right? Yeah,

[Speaker 2]
Two beekeepers when you arrived.

[Speaker 2]
So, where is this smoking?

[Speaker 1]
I don't know. I only saw his image, I think. Do we have

[Speaker 2]
Any seeking magic to the party? Like, if we know I was like this? I can try to maybe learn a smell for that I have.

[Speaker 4]
You can also

[Speaker 2]
Learn teleport, I think maybe we get. While we figure it out, we got Phineas to maybe lower teleportation. That would, by far, be the most useful.

[Speaker 1]
Well, if you manages, then that would be.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, DM, what's a system where we can roll for finance learning California? Say. Because I am down for you guys to get a little bit more utility out of videos if you want.

[Speaker 3]
That his main interest when he was the kid was always teleport.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, that's crazy. Um, I'll say it'll be like a,

[Speaker 1]
Uh. Really, really, really want to teleport people? I just want to

[Speaker 3]
Be a a transportation

[Speaker 2]
Fan for people. I'll say it'll take an investment of time and money. Okay, uh, I'll say within. Next two weeks. And I believe, I don't know how much it takes for a wizard to learn a spell. Um,

[Speaker 3]
Oh yeah, he's a wizard. Can't they like, learn a spellboard? That's right,

[Speaker 2]
Yeah. Don't

[Speaker 3]
We have door with them? Spelledo, we

[Speaker 2]
Do.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, I think Michael does. It's like, okay, and we learn faster.

[Speaker 2]
It's an important question, I'll say, uh. Weeks. And because he already has adorable spell bug instead of whatever it would have been, which I think is pretty expensive. I'll say 50 gold technical, and he'll learn teleport. So you can cast that, like, what's right here? We'll say.

[Speaker 2]
He's like a Pokemon. Yeah,

[Speaker 1]
Weighed 50 gold cast it. That was on 50 goals for the two weeks. Yeah, you'll learn like over the next two weeks, he'll like practice.

[Speaker 2]
Which will cost you some gold because it costs like materials and whatnot. We can afford

[Speaker 1]
It. We can so afford it.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah,

[Speaker 2]
We check with, uh,

[Speaker 1]
We have like 600 plus. Sorry,

[Speaker 2]
I'm gonna get a lot more cynical about this. Oh, it's, yeah, it's verbal. It doesn't have a material info.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, okay.

[Speaker 2]
We're gonna, we're gonna put our trust in you. Well. So, just to be clear, what, what is my role here now? Because I'm still a researcher for the most part, your research as much as you want,

[Speaker 4]
We're gonna keep

[Speaker 2]
We're gonna yeah, keep researching. Yeah,

[Speaker 1]
What can I say Phineas? You want to see more or less fellows. Do you want to snap you?

[Speaker 2]
I know well that that's great. And I appreciate that, especially coming from my own sister. That's, like, um.

[Speaker 2]
So much information, and I was already on the verge of publishing a paper about this. And now, I have significantly more information about it. So, I mean, if it were up to me, and as far as I understand it, it is up to me. And it does. I would just continue writing and publish this paper as fast as I can.

[Speaker 5]
What traveling with us help you with your paper?

[Speaker 2]
I mean, to be honest, it probably we're gonna

[Speaker 1]
Tell.

[Speaker 2]
You know. But

[Speaker 4]
What if we could get you to another academic who could read your review, like, remove your review?

[Speaker 2]
He goes. Well, that's interesting. Um, what academic,

[Speaker 1]
What's her name?

[Speaker 2]
Oh,

[Speaker 3]
I thought you were talking about the coffee guy, the guy you

[Speaker 1]
Know?

[Speaker 1]
No, we have lesava is locked away in that Tower or brainwashed in that Tower. Yeah.

[Speaker 2]
Uh, make a persuasion Shack. I'll say whoever wants to. No, he's advantage. Persuasion with advantage.

[Speaker 4]
23,

[Speaker 2]
He's beaten, uh, he goes. Well, I mean, if you can give me access to some Asurion. Scholars. That would probably be very nice. I mean, especially the, uh, you said, you had a professor in

[Speaker 4]
New York. Yep.

[Speaker 2]
It's really good. It's different. Well, it depends on how? Like, is it like a strong connection? Like, we can get this paper like published action, or is it more like?

[Speaker 4]
A you have to publish it, but like I can get him to read it.

[Speaker 2]
Okay. So, what are we going to do in this two weeks? We'll finance, learns how to teleport us out here. Wait, was Phineas, or from the ishir Empire?

[Speaker 1]
No, right? No,

[Speaker 2]
That's from New York City.

[Speaker 1]
He's from Edgar. Okay,

[Speaker 2]
He's probably supposed to get back to the to the aquarium circle

[Speaker 4]
There,

[Speaker 1]
But why aren't you from the wildlife?

[Speaker 3]
No, we're from, like, silver, Crocker,

[Speaker 2]
Yeah,

[Speaker 1]
But we've been moving about Wildlife.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, the pardon, Steinbergris met in the, uh,

[Speaker 1]
Oh how romantic, yeah.

[Speaker 2]
Uh, located to the last respite

[Speaker 4]
And get our fun Lou.

[Speaker 2]
You guys make it eventually back to the last respite, uh, waiting for you. There is Max.

[Speaker 1]
Yes, uh,

[Speaker 2]
Immediately greets you back. He's like, what's up?

[Speaker 1]
Oh my God, that's a lot of loot,

[Speaker 2]
And he looks back at you guys like carrying. I don't even know how you're carrying it like three bam bears like investigated, just like foreign the whole thing. He looks at. Normal done. And he's like, what happened to this guy? He lost his. He lost his mind. Unfortunately, he lost his mind. I mean, you said that every exhibition that goes in there? No one comes out alive. This is our casual dude. Oh, and another one.

[Speaker 1]
Diameter is with your party, right?

[Speaker 3]
Um. He decided to retire. Yeah,

[Speaker 4]
Oh yeah, yeah,

[Speaker 2]
And stuck business. Yeah. That, you know, rest in peace or whatever, um, okay, the lavender that doesn't drink it. It's another toothpick for him, um. He goes. Well, he's off fantastic stuff. And obviously, we can take, uh, we can buy some of this stuff for me, because there's some way too much stuff. I, I assume you want something to craft as well, not that. Bullshit, yep, amazing. Okay, let's get you situated. Let's get you in there, uh? Shit that you guys doing. That's amazing. You guys walk back into the last respite. There is cheers, uh, seeing kind of all the stuff that you kill the few flaps. A few people who look at you very jealously from the corner.

[Speaker 2]
Network clearly infuriated by the fact that you're right now. Uh, you've made the name for yourself here, despite being completely new. Yeah, um, do we gotta? Do we get our name on the door? I think I remember something about our dragon. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, they're still hot there.

[Speaker 2]
Wow, you're back. That's fucking

[Speaker 3]
Crazy. Where is, where's the rest of your party? Where are these guys, I love them? Oh

[Speaker 2]
Yeah. Sorry, Maxab. They didn't make it. They got killed by me, last years actually. Uh, and Max goes. For once, it wasn't the one of the monsters, I guess. You know what, uh, rest in peace? Uh, anyways, welcome back Phineas, uh?

[Speaker 1]
I love Max.

[Speaker 2]
You guys all get, uh, rescued back in. Until we get the long rest now. Yes, fuck. Long risk. All right, you craft all the things that you want to. Craft is, so,

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, who has a

[Speaker 2]
List who has a list, so I'm pretty sure I added most of them to DMTbond already, but let's check we have the

[Speaker 4]
Warhammer the. Is that

[Speaker 2]
The water explode the wherever that explodes? Uh, it is. I'm thinking beyond that one, um. So, whoever wants to claim it? Can

[Speaker 4]
I think that's you, right?

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, I think that's you. And then we

[Speaker 4]
Have the characters from the band Barrow.

[Speaker 2]
What's that? What's a character armor I just

[Speaker 4]
Wrote down? I don't have any details. Oh my goodness,

[Speaker 7]
Did we get a glow gun as well? Yep!

[Speaker 1]
Wait, I had a few stuff, right? I don't

[Speaker 2]
See carapace. So, the carabus hasn't been added yet because you guys were also deciding on whether, uh, silril or bye should get it. Yeah, what? What is a carapace? It's farmers, uh, I'll show you what the specs of it are. Uh, the Bambaro super heavy Warhammer is indeed there.

[Speaker 2]
I will get that. We made so many things.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, we actually did.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, I just added just to see what kind of damages I do.

[Speaker 2]
You can add it. Take a look at it.

[Speaker 1]
What's it called? Wait, so I forgot already. Warhammer

[Speaker 2]
And the Warhammer, that's correct.

[Speaker 4]
I think the ones that aren't checked off are the ones we wanted to get, but we didn't.

[Speaker 2]
Wait, where's this list? It's

[Speaker 4]
All the way at the bottom of the dock, or like middle middle.

[Speaker 2]
This is a carapace, uh, medium armor. You cannot be pushed or not. Chrome, your residentification is slashing damage. You count as a size higher than you usually do and have an advantage on con saving throws, but have disinvention on deck saving grows. But Dex is my thing.

[Speaker 4]
Unless we hunted the.

[Speaker 2]
That's fine. I, that's sorry.

[Speaker 1]
Do

[Speaker 8]
You guys remember me? How did the gum the blind? No, we never actually

[Speaker 2]
Saw. It never happened. Yeah, the horse. You have the horn. And it's in DMD Beyond. If you said that,

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, I added that, who didn't? We decided was gonna take the horn.

[Speaker 2]
How do I add like, oh, one action,

[Speaker 4]
Uh, we have dragon cocaine? I don't know why, I don't know what's happening. Is, what

[Speaker 1]
Was it? I think that

[Speaker 3]
Was from before. We already have that, but we

[Speaker 4]
Didn't like make it yet.

[Speaker 1]
Surely the Dragonborn carry the dragon. Okay,

[Speaker 2]
It was, uh, I believe it was the the, the the, the the, you have all the bombs. Yes, yes, probably. Oh, ready to go. I think I removed it because what's it called? Yeah.

[Speaker 2]
Out.

[Speaker 1]
Wait, isn't this? Isn't that the cocaine that what's it called the sniffing? I don't think so. I thought it was.

[Speaker 3]
No, there's a different one that the dragon gave us. I think you deleted it because we fought the dragon already.

[Speaker 2]
Give me a second.

[Speaker 2]
Uh, okay, so there's the Bam Barrel battle horn. There's the Bam Barrel hook, super heavy Warhammer. There was also the basil G's charged to great ax. Oh yeah, charge the ball sorry, yeah, yeah. Was? The green dragon powder, oh, cause I'm resisting the fire damage. Yeah, and this

[Speaker 3]
One lets me crip more, and I already get.

[Speaker 2]
Oh yeah, okay, so I'm taking one down. The battlegees charged Mall,

[Speaker 3]
Beetlejuice. Yes,

[Speaker 2]
Beetle juice charge wrong. The green dragon sack powder, I believe, is what you're referring to. Sergio, uh, okay. That I'm I'm seeing if I can add. And then there was the. The bubble thing? Uh, what mall is it called puzzle juice? Okay, yeah, which is the?

[Speaker 2]
Whoever wants to take that one? What? What gun? The water? Fox river?

[Speaker 2]
Okay, where the hell are these

[Speaker 1]
Things? Did we

[Speaker 3]
Fight rafalos, or is that just the only name that I know from Monster Hunter, so I recognize it?

[Speaker 2]
Might just be the other neighborhood now. Uh, and the water wyvern bubble gum. Let me see what that does. It does an extra 1d4 acid damage on hits. Okay, pull a slick liquid of a radius. Bubble Gunner blow gun, uh, bubble gum, okay? You know, what's crazy? My blade? It is still way better.

[Speaker 5]
It's 1d, 10, plus, five. It's because it's because you haven't. Uh,

[Speaker 2]
How do I bind it? You have to go through your options if, yeah.

[Speaker 3]
I'll take it

[Speaker 1]
Next. 20, wow. I, I think that is a mistake. I think it made a mistake obviously makes no sense. What a radius of 10 feet.

[Speaker 2]
Was, so am I meeting circumference? Is that I

[Speaker 1]
Think I'm meaning diameter because radius that means it would be 20.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah?

[Speaker 3]
He already nerfed the other gun we gave you. That's true.

[Speaker 4]
How many times did we fight the Bachelors only once, right,

[Speaker 2]
One once? Yeah, because the second time you tried, do you missed your first shot with a charge rifle and you're like, nope, what's this? Holy shit, never mind. Yeah, you're right,

[Speaker 3]
2D,

[Speaker 5]
Six, plus five.

[Speaker 5]
Plus 2d6 initial damage. Oh wait, no.

[Speaker 2]
We're talking about 2d6 initial damage and then one D6 at the start.

[Speaker 2]
Um, yeah, I believe, that's. So, uh, over kind of, uh, the next two days, more or less. The whole last respite. There's like a few people who work there permanently, every time. For Carva, everything from the monsters. Plus the materials. They take the material that they don't need, and they use kind of that gold to add bunch of materials that you would have otherwise needed for the weapons, and eventually you guys get that. Hold your weapons and their attitude manufacturers. So? Uh, you also, do you guys also get like a significant monetary bonus for the amount of stuff that you brought in?

[Speaker 2]
And you guys each get 50 Golds cool. Well, I'm Dart poor, so? Oh, never mind. Yeah, I think

[Speaker 3]
It's kind of like a indentured servitude where, like, we make money. And then it goes analogy.

[Speaker 2]
A big bag that unlocks the sugar daddy.

[Speaker 1]
I guess I'll Finance, um, Mr Money Banks if Phineas is learning finish

[Speaker 2]
Straight.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, could we also after that train him to learn haste?

[Speaker 2]
Oh, his will be nice. You guys,

[Speaker 3]
We might as well just make it. I really want Ace again. I just realized I don't get vented anymore because, well, wait. So, what

[Speaker 1]
Do we sell? Exactly, just like the parts, the parts. Yeah, all right. What are we doing with all these anti-ether bests because I have a lot of them? And guns have a lot of guns.

[Speaker 2]
What the hell is this?

[Speaker 1]
Sorry, sorry. Bags. I've got some stuff I want to even take a look at it. Like, I put down just the bag, right? And then I start taking out like, it's like, uh, the what's it called, the bad guy I take out, like one gun, two gun, yeah, three guns?

[Speaker 3]
We can fuel the Edgar war machine to buy literally. What is

[Speaker 2]
This? How does it work? What's up with this, um?

[Speaker 1]
Well. We found some of the staff and he just holds it upside down for like points it downwards. I don't know, be careful with that, be careful with that. Well, actually, this one's not charged so you can mess around with this one. Oh, okay, but? Absolutely pulls the trigger. What the fuck,

[Speaker 2]
What does it do?

[Speaker 1]
Um, here, I'll show you. Actually, I think he just killed someone. Um, the fact that they want to demonstrate? Yeah, so I hang my garden.

[Speaker 4]
Uh, I won't load it. I guess it's just a level one spell. Um. So, what I'm doing is I'm using my spell in my ether to power the weapon, and then that'll make it shoot more damage. Whoa.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
Okay.

[Speaker 4]
And I guess, uh, Meg will just, uh, shoot.

[Speaker 2]
Yo, kill the Sheep over there. He points towards the street,

[Speaker 4]
Literally. Not gonna do that. Um, I'll just shoot at, like a tree, or something okay.

[Speaker 2]
He goes. Are you selling this? Are you selling this? Are we selling that? We're following this,

[Speaker 1]
Some of them.

[Speaker 3]
At the right price.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, very deeply interested.

[Speaker 4]
This is like.

[Speaker 2]
Here's another question for you. Can you make more of these?

[Speaker 4]
We can, you can, we cannot. Oh, you cannot you, you might, you could I guess.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, hello.

[Speaker 2]
Uh, he snaps his fingers and immediately. Like, you see, uh, it's like young Dragonborn man who comes over. He has like a vest on. He's got like a bunch of tools and some goggles. He was working on some of your weapons.

[Speaker 1]
Loyo, come here. Oh, look at this thing. I mean,

[Speaker 2]
It just passes off to him. Uh, he goes, it's okay, right? It's okay, he looks at it. It's not like. And we're

[Speaker 1]
Good. You can rent it out to you, for sure is he. Wait, oh, who's the guy that's holding him?

[Speaker 2]
Oh, uh, yeah, that's wait, what's your name again? And he goes, my name is Andrew. And he goes, yeah, yeah, Andrew, uh,

[Speaker 1]
That's my guy, he's my guy, he just, you know, he makes the win Andrew Warrior problem. It's okay with me.

[Speaker 2]
He looks so sad for some reason. He goes so. I'll take a look. Uh, Max goes. Yeah, it's all right, right?

[Speaker 3]
If my guy takes a little, please hit charge checks. Look at what?

[Speaker 3]
Make the

[Speaker 4]
Rifle

[Speaker 3]
That lowers the price of our

[Speaker 1]
Right for all. I'm concerned if we put one of these at the hands of every single Acurian Soldier, we have a we stand a chance of winning the war,

[Speaker 3]
But we can do that and make some money. That's all I'm saying.

[Speaker 2]
Do we need more?

[Speaker 1]
You have that little honor.

[Speaker 3]
I'm not your country. Do that same thing. We do that and make money. And we can do both videos

[Speaker 2]
Goes kite, disappointed of you. I mean, this is here, we're.

[Speaker 3]
Helping, Edgar, I'm just saying charge them like at least 50 bucks for this.

[Speaker 2]
So there's a little pop-up screen on the top of Phineas, saying Phineas will remember that.

[Speaker 1]
Videos disapproves. Um,

[Speaker 4]
I agree with you, Kate. We should sell it.

[Speaker 2]
Okay,

[Speaker 1]
Well, how about? I mean, if we buy it, there's ours, right?

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, I guess so. Okay, great. How

[Speaker 1]
Much of this can we buy it?

[Speaker 2]
How many do we have? We don't have

[Speaker 1]
To solid here, exactly. We're gonna take it elsewhere, and we know. Elwyn is somewhere in aeger. Maybe he could take a look

[Speaker 4]
That might be better because I feel like if they get the hands on these as much as like, I hate these monsters. I feel like it might just empower a lot of cultures too.

[Speaker 1]
How's the island,

[Speaker 2]
What we would never do that?

[Speaker 4]
So, maybe your

[Speaker 2]
Dad?

[Speaker 1]
As much as it pays me, Max, I feel like I have to take this off the table.

[Speaker 4]
Are you serious?

[Speaker 1]
Look away. It totally starts falling his eyes. He starts crying. He's so upset,

[Speaker 2]
He goes.

[Speaker 1]
Are you sure? Every. This is really cool. I was so sorry to disappoint you. Can we not

[Speaker 2]
Get in one?

[Speaker 4]
No,

[Speaker 1]
Just what

[Speaker 4]
I'm sorry you asked me to kill a sheep. How about this?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah,

[Speaker 4]
But it doesn't bear really well for like

[Speaker 1]
Your mom. It's stupid.

[Speaker 2]
Who walks his eyes, he goes. Yeah, yeah, whatever I didn't even care. He's deeply hurt by his interaction. Oh no,

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, we should have brought it out. Yeah.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, well, why don't we? We had to teleportation. I think I'm done with this island. Ouch,

[Speaker 1]
What are we teleporting to?

[Speaker 4]
Uh, it's in the basement of somewhere.

[Speaker 2]
Are

[Speaker 1]
There any other teleportation Rings we can take?

[Speaker 2]
What are your assistant Max? I'm not talking to you, he's Andrew. Um, yeah, there's like a few. Um, let me try to finish a second. Oh my God, I love it.

[Speaker 4]
I love. I never used characters.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, I love everything.

[Speaker 1]
Bros.

[Speaker 2]
Thanks! Thanks!

[Speaker 1]
Of a weirdo.

[Speaker 2]
It's not fun to play normal characters.

[Speaker 1]
This is a this is a freaky world.

[Speaker 3]
Uh, there we go.

[Speaker 3]
I guess it would

[Speaker 2]
Be. Oh wow, this is compressed. This is a fucking. Yeah, okay.

[Speaker 4]
When you cook it,

[Speaker 2]
Uh, rustera lustera? I'll stay right, I don't know. I can't believe the site is still up. Honestly, I haven't touched it in, like a year. There we go.

[Speaker 1]
It's still boring on those websites.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I have not cleared it. Of that. That's fine, uh, I'm pretty. I don't remember where you guys came from. Actually, I believe it was a maven door. No, like, here. I think it was in Padina, right? Yeah.

[Speaker 3]
Is it a big city? It was like,

[Speaker 2]
I don't remember.

[Speaker 3]
We tried to save kava,

[Speaker 2]
Right? Yeah, yeah. And then, running away

[Speaker 3]
From saving kava, we got to an Inn that we teleported out.

[Speaker 2]
Okay,

[Speaker 1]
Yeah,

[Speaker 2]
Uh, yeah, so he goes where we buried for.

[Speaker 1]
More outside of, like, some kind of in and Medina.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, and

[Speaker 1]
That's where we also left force in that Guild, right? And he passed like a really hard test with that

[Speaker 3]
Shopkeeper, uh, Orca,

[Speaker 1]
Right? We're gonna go back to him completely forgot his name.

[Speaker 4]
We used to bring him back something I really wanted to like, help his business out. He was so nice. It

[Speaker 1]
Was really nice. Let's sell him

[Speaker 3]
One of the best.

[Speaker 1]
I also

[Speaker 4]
Just the best. Yeah, yeah, the

[Speaker 3]
Best we can.

[Speaker 4]
That's true.

[Speaker 3]
It's defensive and.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, never mind. Intrusive thought Andrew goes. Oh yeah,

[Speaker 2]
I'm pretty sure it was, like, wooden, cavito, and um, maybe we're all in Tallburg. There's probably one in Nagan as well. That's where you guys want to go. Oh

[Speaker 1]
Wow, nagana is where.

[Speaker 4]
Oh,

[Speaker 1]
It's also where you're from. It's also where I'm from,

[Speaker 2]
Shall we just go there,

[Speaker 4]
Maybe start there and then,

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, we,

[Speaker 4]
Yeah. His name

[Speaker 3]
Was Ivan,

[Speaker 2]
Um, I wrote it

[Speaker 3]
Down.

[Speaker 2]
Hey, are we ever gonna get to Koreania? Perennial. Yeah, probably not this guy being. Oh, he's so really scary.

[Speaker 4]
Do you have it all? Um, actually, I won't ask, am I?

[Speaker 2]
What's up to you guys?

[Speaker 1]
Where do we start? Adina.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, let's go home first. And then, I, yeah, I'd like to tackle probably the last time. What do you guys think?

[Speaker 1]
Oh,

[Speaker 3]
Another character. I'd like to see Force again. Yeah,

[Speaker 1]
I mean, I was thinking, maybe we could leave door with them with bors, give him like a life purpose. Okay,

[Speaker 2]
They have like a crew of like the rejects that, like, we don't eat temperatures who is in, yeah.

[Speaker 3]
He was learn. Exactly. So, we just have a crew of people relearning how to become Wizards.

[Speaker 2]
You

[Speaker 4]
Guys

[Speaker 2]
Should start your own Academy.

[Speaker 1]
Sports is very wizard in school. For all four little wizards,

[Speaker 3]
It's like Mystics like, you know, elderly babies and talking horses, and it's a

[Speaker 1]
Very small school.

[Speaker 2]
It's like the fucking mutants.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, yeah, exactly. We need to find somebody in a wheelchair.

[Speaker 1]
It's the Fantastic Fours. Yeah.

[Speaker 2]
I yeah, I would like

[Speaker 4]
To see Elvin first, because as soon as we land back in Padina, we are risking, like, best bear or any normal people who know what we look like, yeah, but

[Speaker 1]
We're also not in a rush to get to, um, they're gone right. We could take our time. Boy, my, I say that, like, kind of hesitantly.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, okay. Wasn't there actually like a deadline that we had for something? Yeah, like,

[Speaker 1]
A month,

[Speaker 4]
Maybe a month, but now she doesn't have the books. Yeah,

[Speaker 2]
No, the books.

[Speaker 3]
We're just going to be flowing around, and then eager's gonna be, like, okay, that time movement, I said to you guys now, uh, and the world has ended. You guys blink off

[Speaker 1]
Good campaign guys.

[Speaker 2]
Let's see you next one.

[Speaker 4]
I forget what he said he wants to do.

[Speaker 2]
At this point, you are like a few days away from the deadline that,

[Speaker 4]
Yeah,

[Speaker 2]
You were set,

[Speaker 4]
But Zeke's the scary one because he wants to make the bomb. But Spirit just wants to take over, but he wants to make a bomb. So

[Speaker 2]
We kill him first, sorry.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, yeah,

[Speaker 1]
Like, but then we talked to Zeke and he was like.

[Speaker 4]
Instead of, you can kill her first. I won't do the bomb, but I'm gonna make the bomb in the meantime. Nope.

[Speaker 3]
We kill this pharah. We stop the bomb and we kill Vasquez or we kill him

[Speaker 1]
Or he sets the bomb off anyway. And then we took out his only enemy.

[Speaker 4]
That's true because he's weird. He is weird.

[Speaker 1]
I don't,

[Speaker 4]
Really. He's very weird. He's like

[Speaker 1]
A big sack of like

[Speaker 4]
Meat said he was meaner. Now, Luna was, like, that's not my friend.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, we kill him.

[Speaker 4]
I wanted to get all this, like expensive or nice stuff. Off to Elwyn, so you can kind of keep it and study it or do whatever. And then we can go towards seek.

[Speaker 1]
We have to find them. Maybe Alvin knows

[Speaker 2]
Something. I also know that, uh. The spirit originally. I said that one of the reasons why she was invading Yeager is because there was a high presence of the order of the black sununaker, and she accused Edgar of. How true that is, you don't know

[Speaker 1]
That is alive? She goes after the Bronx, right. Then we found that out later on that she was after lasellos and everything in the books.

[Speaker 3]
So, weapons of mass destruction

[Speaker 1]
Because she wanted to like power and like move her troops around. Yeah,

[Speaker 2]
She needed. Yeah,

[Speaker 1]
That's why she was invading all the confidences to get the Rocks.

[Speaker 3]
She's basically Thanos, she just Thanos. Getting a bunch of different colored rocks

[Speaker 2]
Fuck. I literally

[Speaker 1]
Take all of that.

[Speaker 2]
Not realize until that.

[Speaker 1]
Is pretty good. It's the stairs is inevitable.

[Speaker 9]
How did I not really

[Speaker 1]
Yeah? And Meg is making her a glove. Yeah,

[Speaker 4]
That would have been made from the stones. Yeah, what

[Speaker 1]
Color is her skin?

[Speaker 2]
Uh, she is white, not purple, not purple,

[Speaker 3]
That we know of, I don't know. Turn

[Speaker 4]
Green, right? If there's enough with cellos,

[Speaker 2]
Good

[Speaker 3]
Isn't the. Isn't the one on eighth or is that one purple?

[Speaker 4]
Yeah,

[Speaker 3]
Uh, that's so she doesn't up with that

[Speaker 1]
Rifle, right?

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, two triangles, the one on,

[Speaker 2]
Uh?

[Speaker 2]
If your Empire is purple, or at least you think it's from Titanfall,

[Speaker 1]
That's the one that was in my butt juice.

[Speaker 2]
Yes, and it wasn't your butt.

[Speaker 1]
I have to hide it somewhere. It was at the beginning of the campaign.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, yay!

[Speaker 2]
Okay,

[Speaker 1]
We got very little time and we didn't know what it did. I don't know how valuable it was. And then we got to the Titanfall. And we're, like, oh, this is everywhere.

[Speaker 2]
I get

[Speaker 1]
It all up for nothing.

[Speaker 4]
I think element first, and he comes to help us because he's really skilled at Magic. Maybe you guys and then also my scrying and like team up and ultra scry or something, and before

[Speaker 5]
We go into anywhere dangerous, maybe we leave

[Speaker 2]
Um, what's his name, your brother,

[Speaker 1]
Vegas? Yeah, he might like, Elwood,

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, yeah.

[Speaker 3]
It, um, I mean, I'd like things to hang around, but?

[Speaker 2]
Oh

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, because he wanted me at least they can be because, like, uh Alwyn's, really smart about stuff. Yeah,

[Speaker 3]
So we've lost two people, right? Yeah, so we can use refuel in 15, right? Like this?

[Speaker 4]
I don't think we're allowed to take element, but no.

[Speaker 3]
We take that Source now that he's a fully snow.

[Speaker 1]
I bet I never mind. I'll keep those.

[Speaker 4]
Okay, so we're gonna go to. I forget what it's called the end place. Yeah, yeah, first. Okay,

[Speaker 2]
I got a test. You guys got all situated. You got all your stuff. You say your goodbyes to everyone that's there? Max. Climax the next day! It seems significantly less sad. Uh, he comes up to you guys and says, well, I'm not gonna lie. I'm still bummed out about the whole thing. I mean, to be honest, I was really looking forward to shooting anything. I mean, I was fucking crazy, right? I

[Speaker 1]
Mean, just like, oh,

[Speaker 5]
Once we're done with it, we'll bring it back to you.

[Speaker 3]
Can we let it buy it once? Yeah,

[Speaker 1]
Yeah,

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, I'll charge it up. Oh

[Speaker 3]
Yeah.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, probably.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, the Story Mountain

[Speaker 3]
Or something?

[Speaker 2]
Petting Buffet. Yeah, he's giving a little kiss. Oh, you're a beautiful baby. Oh yeah, I think we

[Speaker 3]
Should.

[Speaker 1]
It

[Speaker 3]
Takes his time.

[Speaker 2]
It shoots out. The fucking tree exploded to a million shards. It immediately goes on fire, he goes. Oh, hell, yeah, this is amazing.

[Speaker 3]
I should have had him shoot me. Could that be cool?

[Speaker 2]
What I mean? I agree with that. You want to drive that. We try that.

[Speaker 3]
No, and you've already shot it. Once we only gave you one shot.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, sorry, all right.

[Speaker 2]
Well. You guys might have just been the most exceptional Hunters many wildlands have seen in the past. I could say to me, let's be real, okay. Praise.

[Speaker 4]
Can you make sure not to tell anybody that you've met us that we have these guns? Oh

[Speaker 2]
No, that information is logged on. Maybe it is so out there. There is no way I can contain that.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, that's what you mean. Awesome.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah,

[Speaker 5]
Yeah,

[Speaker 2]
Wait, well, I mean, I, you guys are the most accepted electors the last two decades. Of course, people are gonna don't forget it.

[Speaker 4]
Already. Oh

[Speaker 2]
No, the guns is between you.

[Speaker 4]
Okay, keep the guns.

[Speaker 3]
I mean, we have just fired it twice in this. Like, heavily crowded place. He, he pulled you out from the side. He

[Speaker 2]
Was, like, other people are gonna be jealous. If they're all about this, so you know,

[Speaker 3]
It's horrible.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, we're going to

[Speaker 5]
Make some X. We're going to come by and see you sometime. I

[Speaker 2]
Would love that. Fucking God.

[Speaker 5]
He's just. He's just a South and American.

[Speaker 1]
This is a red dice.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah,

[Speaker 1]
You guys know Demolition Ranch.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, yeah,

[Speaker 2]
Yeah. Most of my inspiration for this character was from Flint. Uh,

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, I feel like I got it all. He goes

[Speaker 2]
Best of luck. Uh, yeah, sorry, your friends is like a baby. Or, like, that's okay, we'll find a place for him. Yeah,

[Speaker 5]
Max, you're a legend.

[Speaker 1]
Never forget you! I'll probably forget about you eventually. Uh, now if you

[Speaker 2]
Bring me those guys,

[Speaker 5]
Not if we have a clock.

[Speaker 2]
Hey, fucking thing

[Speaker 1]
Our names will always be up there. Yeah, right there,

[Speaker 5]
Right

[Speaker 2]
There. And if anyone touches him, I'll fucking kill them. Thank you, thank you,

[Speaker 3]
Shut. Let's just go,

[Speaker 5]
Let's just go

[Speaker 2]
He, uh. Uh, waves your fee for the teleportation Circle.

[Speaker 1]
Say,

[Speaker 2]
Oh, homie, uh, you guys get teleported all the way to nagan. First time you've been in your hometown since you were? 18 years old.

[Speaker 1]
No, I think it was younger. It was, like, sixty, even

[Speaker 2]
Younger than that. Yeah, wow. Immediately the? Warm and humidity of the place just hits you. It is in the middle of a jungle. It is humid and moist and instant that you land. You feel kind of this, like, uh. Weird, muddy substance under your feet. That is tainted with just like a little bit of like a silverish kind of like reflective material, almost like glitter. As you guys, uh, teleport. What seems to be the middle of like a? A port of some kind, except it's like in the middle of a swamp. Uh, there are a bunch of people who are currently like loading and loading stuff onto boats. And there are these, like, flat, almost like, uh?

[Speaker 2]
Uh, barge. Is that the right word, a barge looking things that don't have like much, you know of anything going on, besides just wood and a fucking bast? And, like, some, uh, some rowing things? There's people around moving everywhere you notice immediately. The vast majority of people here are either Dragonborn or, uh, dwarves or human. There's not much of anything else. Immediately. As we teleport, uh, there's a person who comes, uh, to greet you, uh, this kind of, like dormish woman. Has like completely shaved off head as like, big. Piercing her nose. She's she has like a clipboard, like a feather, and she's literally writing something down. And she goes.

[Speaker 2]
Welcome to the barn! Uh, this is the, I assume, do you know where you are, are you from here? Yep, uh, yes, I am, uh, you know, where you are, you're at the? A place of Nagan. That's like a little bit further north, and this is where a lot of people are taking stuff from Nagan and immediately trying to ship it as a point. But because nagon is so full of like jungle and just wetness in general, it first has to cross like this kind of like swamp fish directory.

[Speaker 2]
In the ground swamps.

[Speaker 1]
I wear shoes I actually wear. Oh, they can see them. Uh, where did they go?

[Speaker 5]
What we are in. Oh, we're in North Vega.

[Speaker 1]
That's right, I wear These Boots. Nice, yo. Where do you find what? What are those? There are boots of the vigilant. Apparently, why do they look so social realistic? Hey, this is the picture you chose. At like this very, very beginning of the game. Is

[Speaker 5]
This some Rick Owens?

[Speaker 1]
I don't know it. Ricky's, yeah. I have no idea I. At the beginning, I thought, like? Actually, I don't know. It was like back when Samuel was playing. I think yeah, this was like in the the first two months, something down back in the basement.

[Speaker 2]
Anyway. Welcome to the swamp! I guess you don't have anything to declare?

[Speaker 5]
And

[Speaker 1]
Are we supposed to declare anything? Yeah,

[Speaker 4]
What do you mean?

[Speaker 2]
Oh well, if you're bringing over. 500 gold worth of live animals or agricultural?

[Speaker 5]
Oh my God, no

[Speaker 4]
Drugs,

[Speaker 5]
Nothing like that. No,

[Speaker 3]
I declare that I'm not that I'm not wrong.

[Speaker 1]
We're not doing that, right? Not that I'm aware we

[Speaker 3]
Got a lot of drugs, man,

[Speaker 4]
But there's no,

[Speaker 1]
We don't wear them. Bring 500 gold worth of drugs.

[Speaker 2]
You have a full jar of lacella chowder. Is

[Speaker 4]
That a drug

[Speaker 1]
A rock?

[Speaker 3]
You're gonna

[Speaker 2]
Try, uh, either, uh? If you think you're lying can make deception if you're trying to convince them because

[Speaker 1]
Somebody else say it for me.

[Speaker 3]
Why the fuck do you have plus 13 deception? I don't remember,

[Speaker 1]
Why

[Speaker 4]
Is

[Speaker 1]
Mine? I thought we were speaking again,

[Speaker 3]
But I don't think I should do it. I cannot

[Speaker 1]
Lie.

[Speaker 4]
From being a Bard.

[Speaker 2]
Let me know. That's right.

[Speaker 1]
But like, is, it actually sounds like I was founder would be a drunk. Does hemlock know it to be a drug? Asking you. I don't know the answer, so I don't think how much it is a drug, right?

[Speaker 3]
Do I need to roll or

[Speaker 1]
Roll the deck?

[Speaker 2]
Dude, you can scrap it.

[Speaker 5]
Ooh, Nat, one start,

[Speaker 2]
Okay,

[Speaker 5]
Particular inspiration. No,

[Speaker 3]
I have Advantage. Okay.

[Speaker 2]
As I remember, bartic inspiration was a spell that people can see so.

[Speaker 3]
I am, so

[Speaker 4]
That was so sick. I don't

[Speaker 3]
Do drugs. I've never. What's a drug even like drugs? Are

[Speaker 2]
You said no?

[Speaker 3]
Just, cuz I'm furry. That's racist.

[Speaker 1]
I reached into my bike and I just take out like five goals, and I put it in her head. Park goes a lot with advantages.

[Speaker 2]
Come on! Was a lot. It's 500 bucks, not

[Speaker 1]
20.

[Speaker 2]
He plugs it. She goes have a wonderful day.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, to be back home.

[Speaker 2]
Do you do drugs like that? No, it's not so shut up, shut up. We pull her away, uh, you guys arrive into gone. Uh, you lead them through of this, uh, town. What does, uh, how much feel being back in his own camera after so long?

[Speaker 1]
You see that I'm not saying much, and I look very, very, very uneasy as I'm walking. Like, through the streets, I'm kind of like looking around. My eyes are darting a bit. Um. Yeah, I'm not saying much about it. I'm keeping to myself, but you can tell that. Yeah.

[Speaker 4]
So, Hemlock, do you have any friends still? It's weird

[Speaker 3]
Enemies. We should be aware of. Friends, no friends.

[Speaker 1]
I was young, but I left here really young, and I never came back. I grew up here, but. I don't think this is my home anymore.

[Speaker 4]
Where is your your home, your child's at home?

[Speaker 1]
I kind of just look away.

[Speaker 5]
But maybe we, uh, maybe we leave them alone for a bit?

[Speaker 4]
Have you left alone?

[Speaker 1]
No, we should find.

[Speaker 1]
We should just keep keep going.

[Speaker 4]
Well, I'm pretty hungry. Do you guys want to like, go to a bar or something really quick, sure?

[Speaker 1]
To you. Are you sure? Yep, drink will be good.

[Speaker 4]
Any kind of, yeah, food or drinking facility?

[Speaker 2]
Absolutely. Everyone, uh, this is a large city. If you want, you can describe kind of what you think. Home. Looks like I can pick up whatever you don't want, but if you have anything that you could always want here, um.

[Speaker 1]
Well, I mean, I guess it depends where we're going because the way I imagined it because I mean from what you told me, yeah? Like, from the way you described. Hey girl, back. Back in the days back in the day, I don't know if it's exactly it is now, but What what I remember is you saying? Is that like in the mountains and the in the center of Edgar? There was like a lot of like mining going on, and they had all these rare. Like minerals and whatever. And like all the lumber and like the agarian, like the jungle or whatever, I always imagined it to be like a very.

[Speaker 1]
And the fact that it was like a city state. I imagined it to be like a very like class disparage. Yeah, like city, where there was like the the like the swamps as you described. But as you go further, like into the city center, like you can see, like all these intricates. Is made out of like these, like luxurious trees that are different, like in different colors. And there's like Stone, like big Stone buildings with all these like encrusted gems inside of them, and like the insides of buildings are like dazzling, and there's like colored glass everywhere.

[Speaker 2]
That's a fancy saying, wow. Of disparity in the city, kind of. To all of you. And at first, you walk through what are considered the swampy nor poor parts of town, which eventually, as we said, give way to. A more offensive hard time. All of a sudden, the wet mud from underneath your feet is replaced by Solid Stone. The streets become cleaner and cleaner, uh, you encounter a few guards and whatnot, but you pass them without issuing. Thanks to people who are from here, um. You get closer and closer to what would effectively be considered kind of the center of this place.

[Speaker 2]
You encounter, uh, the kind of large building. That is the Nagan University. Hour and have the school here. Encounter at the Town Hall amongst the other important buildings, the libraries, and whatnot. It is a, despite being mostly centered around Mining and natural resources, so it has a very decent academic Community with a lot of intelligent people. All you also notice. Very strong amount of churches. Specifically to Lua, I believe that's correct. I, I don't remember correctly. Quite a few churches dedicated to Lua. A lot of things kind of symbolizing the moon and so on. You guys eventually find a small Tavern, uh, called the Buddy spoon.

[Speaker 2]
That you enter. It is full of life. There are plenty of people who workers are dieting and drinking there. The bartender greets you, and the afternoon is two years of rush.

[Speaker 5]
I'm gonna go check out the Lewis Temple carrying Laura's Edge. I think it's time, I, you know, I've sensed that? You know, I'm not the true owner of the sword. I know that. I've heard of the tales of the previous owner, and I want to pay Respect by. You know, now I have a a few weapons of my own, the glave, the mall. I wanna I wanna return lua's Edge? To the faith that that it would benefit the most and maybe impress my own goddess in doing that.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, you go ahead, uh, you visit one of the Turkey Garden nearby. Oh, fairly small in comparison to the church's well, the church that you came from, especially, uh, which is kind of this elaborate. It kind of marble, colored glass, and everything in comparison, even despite the fact that it is in kind of this richer, more cleavier, part of town. Uh, there are a few people who are kind of, uh, praying the pews. There is. No kind of very fancy kind of light fixtures or anything like that. It doesn't seem to be any, like, kind of inherent, like, magical thing going off around here. That's fine.

[Speaker 5]
That's perfect. Milo's definitely more of that than the fancy stuff.

[Speaker 2]
You find a priest there on my purse, I'm sorry. Well,

[Speaker 5]
Man priest, yeah.

[Speaker 2]
Kind of this, uh? This human man seems to be in, like his 40s or so, as it's like very scraggly beard with this. Like, very long curled hair, and he goes welcome to West Church. How can I help you?

[Speaker 5]
Chris, I am. I'm a believer of another Faith, but here I have a. Of yours that I believe would benefit your followers a lot. Um. Just in respect to, uh? Now that I found my true faith. I don't feel. That, uh, I feel that there's someone much more deserving of this Relic than myself. So, here I present Lewis Edge. It belonged to. Uh, to someone who Faithfully followed Lua. Until it's deaf.

[Speaker 3]
And uh,

[Speaker 5]
It has helped me on my journey so far, and I'd like to.

[Speaker 2]
We have heat vowels, and he takes it graciously. Uh, he goes. I really appreciate it. What comes? And eventually goes always comes back. What's the cycle and you've participated in it now? I don't ask for anything

[Speaker 5]
In return. Maybe I'll I'll, um, if you allow me or make a greeting to your artist, uh, in the in the temple, and then I'll be on my way. My gods are jealous. You want to be careful.

[Speaker 2]
Away. You lose lightness. He kind of like makes a sign his balls. Okay, that's it. Um. You guys re uh rejoined at The Tavern. You're all there, uh Phoenix is there with you as well, so? So adorable down! For the most part, people don't seem to pay attention. It seems to be a quite busy City with a bunch of stuff that I'm not.

[Speaker 1]
So, we're looking for as we're kind of eating or like, do we even know where Elvin is? Collins still.

[Speaker 4]
I was just kind of going off of what you guys said he was here.

[Speaker 2]
Can we give him a ring?

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, yeah,

[Speaker 3]
I mean, I've never even met him. So, oh.

[Speaker 2]
Can you use the stone?

[Speaker 4]
I have sending.

[Speaker 1]
I think I gave it to you, right? I don't have it anymore.

[Speaker 2]
Some of that?

[Speaker 4]
I didn't add it to my inventory.

[Speaker 1]
I do not have.

[Speaker 1]
How far?

[Speaker 2]
Hello,

[Speaker 4]
Oh, I was, is this Elwood?

[Speaker 4]
Sorry, this is the first time using this. Um,

[Speaker 2]
Do you know what monkey Stones?

[Speaker 4]
Have stones.

[Speaker 2]
This is a stone you're using a stone head

[Speaker 4]
Or stone, though.

[Speaker 1]
A lot

[Speaker 4]
Anyways. Um, I'm with. Hemlock and the rest of them. You don't know so well, so I'm not gonna name them.

[Speaker 2]
My headlock.

[Speaker 4]
So, we were wondering where you were living right now, because we have some really cool stuff. That is kind of like War level

[Speaker 2]
Weapons speaking by language. Yes, I'm currently still in the garden. Um, that's perfect. We're here, too.

[Speaker 3]
He probably asked him that before

[Speaker 5]
He came here.

[Speaker 5]
I've been quite busy these days, but

[Speaker 2]
Uh, perhaps. Tomorrow morning, we can meet, um. Something to somebody to speak, perhaps?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, sounds good. I think I think our our, uh, our tail has been pretty clear recently, so? Not much to worry about that. Glad to know. I

[Speaker 2]
Mean, therego is a little bit easier to. Hiding, so that's fantastic. Please have some dates and a location. I would have to be too specific about

[Speaker 1]
It tomorrow

[Speaker 2]
Morning. You can meet up with them.

[Speaker 4]
And do you want us to grab you anything for the money spoon?

[Speaker 2]
The Buddy's food.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, we're here right now. No,

[Speaker 2]
I fucking hate that place.

[Speaker 4]
Okay,

[Speaker 5]
This is so rude. Always

[Speaker 4]
So nice talking to you.

[Speaker 1]
No, I,

[Speaker 2]
I like him.

[Speaker 4]
I

[Speaker 1]
Like his brutal and I really restored this guy. We've helped him at every single time, and he always gives us sass. So, so has he, though, that's true.

[Speaker 5]
Every, every single session

[Speaker 1]
Dials Elvis.

[Speaker 2]
What you doing?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, I didn't

[Speaker 2]
Trust me nearly as much after you have a Allied yourself with those Barrel, which doesn't remember.

[Speaker 1]
That's true, but we did kind of like we were, like, okay, you know,

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, we still chose him above all, but we saw him as very rarely.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, I finally remembered. What? Uh, his voice was supposed to sound like that. Okay. You guys have a relatives next video, uh, you understand why he's saying that the money spoon is kind of shit, um? Definitely much too expensive for what it is.

[Speaker 1]
Um.

[Speaker 2]
I'll say, like.

[Speaker 5]
A

[Speaker 2]
Gold for

[Speaker 3]
A goal for a meal.

[Speaker 1]
It's like a what

[Speaker 3]
The fuck. It's

[Speaker 1]
Like a Michelin star restaurant.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, it's expensive as hell, and it was made as hell.

[Speaker 1]
The fuck. Damn, whoever wants to take the gold. It doesn't like what it was like eating in the UK,

[Speaker 2]
Not, not a good person, just to

[Speaker 5]
Be clear. Oh, I read a second ago.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, good. It's on the money bank, um?

[Speaker 2]
Here with the Tavern, so those rooms as well. Or you can get room somewhere else, but doesn't really matter. Is there anything else that you guys wanted to do before you met up without it?

[Speaker 1]
No, I

[Speaker 5]
Don't wanna I don't wanna put him in a nursing home that's depressing?

[Speaker 1]
Oh, he needs extra or kindergarten. I feel

[Speaker 3]
Like

[Speaker 1]
For an Elder's

[Speaker 4]
Home, he just has dementia, right? She's gonna die before he learns anything new.

[Speaker 1]
I didn't want to say it.

[Speaker 3]
We should leave them with someone that we know. I think somebody is good at treating both the

[Speaker 1]
Elderly and. Young, what

[Speaker 4]
Is that?

[Speaker 3]
What if we like at

[Speaker 4]
Least the people who work at a nursing home are employed?

[Speaker 1]
Maybe elwin can send him? Our what's it called? Yep, yeah, yeah, our makeshift. Cold,

[Speaker 4]
Where Leah now has to take care of a child and an old man?

[Speaker 1]
Maybe we can use our goal to hire some help? Okay, I like

[Speaker 4]
That just higher. I think that's nice. Yeah.

[Speaker 5]
Dumbledore would have liked to. Just like die die in the mountain, like in a ship with a shepherd or something. You know, like, like, drop them off at the shepherd, you know, live his happy life and send the mountains. And

[Speaker 4]
He's not happy, who put himself. Not happy when they're doing that,

[Speaker 3]
He smiled. Yeah,

[Speaker 1]
I mean, the what if, like, we, we could give him like a nice way to live out the rest of his? First days. Maybe, maybe. I think I got beaten on this one.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, I'll respect

[Speaker 1]
Your opinion,

[Speaker 4]
Either pay or reunion. It might make,

[Speaker 1]
Whoa. I'm not gonna euthanize it.

[Speaker 3]
You're not euthanizing

[Speaker 4]
Him, maybe he would? You guys

[Speaker 1]
Are crazy. No,

[Speaker 5]
Not you guys, not me.

[Speaker 2]
Hear Milo's voice in your brain, just letting you

[Speaker 4]
Into your voice.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, Max. Got a point. I,

[Speaker 4]
I

[Speaker 3]
Think we should not kill him, give him I will death. That's right,

[Speaker 5]
Dumbledore would want an honorable death.

[Speaker 3]
Is being murdered while you're shitting yourself and honorable Tennessee

[Speaker 5]
Get

[Speaker 4]
Better.

[Speaker 3]
I am not going to be attorneys, I'm sorry,

[Speaker 5]
Italian, your sleep. I could kill Minnesota,

[Speaker 4]
Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
To

[Speaker 5]
Do it. And I'll give them the quickest, most okay. But what if

[Speaker 2]
He survives long enough, or if the process of him returning back to his body is quick enough that he actually becomes conscious because we have no idea what happened to him.

[Speaker 5]
Is it

[Speaker 3]
Canonical that he did to say the word Fireball?

[Speaker 1]
A question is

[Speaker 3]
That Canon, or is that it was that? PT. Joe.

[Speaker 3]
Hmm, he

[Speaker 1]
Did not say those words yet. Okay, well, we still do not know what even happened to him. I mean, it's the

[Speaker 2]
Potential

[Speaker 1]
For life that matters, right? Or the chance of Eternal

[Speaker 5]
Suffering. Yeah, of a trap

[Speaker 1]
Soul. Look, we have enough gold.

[Speaker 2]
I was. Like to be clear. I was in a body and I wasn't conscious, and I'm very glad that I'm not dead. I feel like

[Speaker 4]
I, we were told that he was a vegetable and he was gone, gone. Like, actually,

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, like

[Speaker 4]
We said, no, coming back.

[Speaker 5]
We sent him off well.

[Speaker 2]
This problem into your hands, and

[Speaker 4]
I'm intentionally making any more difficult. Oh my, gosh,

[Speaker 1]
Look, and we have enough money. To put him in a nice place and have a help take care of him.

[Speaker 5]
I respect him too much to just have strangers take care of him until he just passes away. You know, what person can I, uh? Like, can

[Speaker 1]
I? It's like, check. Okay.

[Speaker 3]
It has. He now has experience taking care of someone who has lived a life, but is just restarted their sentence. Nobody has experience taking care

[Speaker 5]
Of a baby in an old man's body. We

[Speaker 3]
Have someone take care of a baby and a horse's body

[Speaker 4]
That I just he's brand new person,

[Speaker 1]
Twenty seven 27

[Speaker 2]
Feet.

[Speaker 4]
I

[Speaker 1]
Don't even think about it for our world.

[Speaker 2]
Actually, only want to roll deception.

[Speaker 2]
Is being influenced by your Divinity.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, I am not. I'm not hiding it. It's obvious,

[Speaker 2]
Uh, it's, yeah. It's obvious that viola is influencing his interest.

[Speaker 1]
You're not sacrificing our friend to your God.

[Speaker 1]
He just was so bummed out. Like I said I, we have enough money. It is, we can take

[Speaker 3]
Care of it.

[Speaker 5]
It's motivated by deity Shore, but my intentions are pure. If if it were my friend?

[Speaker 2]
Plus, I mean, if I manage to find a solution for this, maybe I can bring him back in the same way that he brought me back,

[Speaker 4]
But

[Speaker 5]
There's, but there's no way he's coming back. That's the thing he's in Taiwan.

[Speaker 2]
Like,

[Speaker 4]
You were little guy and big brain. He's no brain,

[Speaker 3]
I mean

[Speaker 5]
Far away. That's how we call the magical place. Yeah,

[Speaker 2]
Regardless of that, I think the fact that maybe it can happen that we don't know is a good argument for why minimum three years?

[Speaker 1]
What the fuck?

[Speaker 1]
Because we're finding an interesting problem. At this point, I want to argue just for your point about,

[Speaker 4]
Oh, my God,

[Speaker 2]
Anyways! Oh, you guys are obviously afraid to make the decision you want, but I also do think that Phineas would make that argument. Yeah, you're

[Speaker 5]
Right, you're right, obviously. Um, okay, fine. I've been beat up and obviously. Go somewhere. I wear my religion on my heart,

[Speaker 3]
But if he needs to be put at okay, a religious person is a big fan,

[Speaker 4]
You know, when they take off support, then you maybe even kill him? Absolutely!

[Speaker 5]
Right? Well, let's be excited.

[Speaker 2]
You guys have a relatively nice video people kind of look at you weird because you're an odd group of people. And there's also like a grown man pushing his pants next to your table, uh, but that goes without too much issue.

[Speaker 3]
I'm eating him as we go as we.

[Speaker 2]
Phineas is continuing on his research. You guys all go to bed. Meg. As you go to sleep, you hear a voice in your head that you reckon them. Excuse me. As covers, and you hear kava in your head go?

[Speaker 2]
No, you're not Kevin. And I know. You were saying the truth you? I patched it together, I realized. Leah,

[Speaker 1]
Right? That's her name.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, yeah, she, yeah.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, the person that we tried to save was the necklace.

[Speaker 1]
That boy tried to throw the window.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, she goes. Yeah,

[Speaker 2]
I wasn't here for this, and

[Speaker 3]
This one before died. Oh, you weren't. I remember, now I pieced it together.

[Speaker 2]
She's asparagus using the same kind of magic that she was using all those students on me. And that's why I forgot. Your weird group. I pieced it together. It took me some time. I've contacted them. They're okay for now. The Sparrow has just realized. Um, that remission failed. You don't have much time before she retaliates.

[Speaker 2]
Best of luck! That's very best

[Speaker 5]
Friend. Explain, like, I'm five? Their cough up. We met her

[Speaker 1]
In the soft spot very, very, very, very long time ago. She was the artificer. I don't know if you remember. Um, she was the artificer in the soft spot. It was like beef skilled or whatever,

[Speaker 5]
Okay, um. I don't understand, like two of those three.

[Speaker 2]
The underbelly, the underground Mafia magic organization. Yeah, that steel stuff, yeah,

[Speaker 5]
Sure. So they're the bad guys.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, no, they were like the they're the speech. Yeah,

[Speaker 5]
Okay, mutual. Bad guys, yeah.

[Speaker 1]
And. While she was married to Leia that we found out eventually.

[Speaker 2]
Uh, the scientist. At the Academy found a Titanfall. We kidnapped her

[Speaker 1]
Then, teleported her.

[Speaker 5]
Okay, so she's the one over there, huh? She's future layer girlfriend coffee link,

[Speaker 1]
Yeah. And then, what?

[Speaker 5]
And then, what do we do to piss her off?

[Speaker 1]
We rest. We found Leia, right, and then Leia told us well while you were rescuing me. Cabo was taken okay, and we

[Speaker 5]
Were,

[Speaker 1]
Like, oh, I guess we can get caught up, and then we did not try to get kava for a long time. And then we

[Speaker 5]
Tried

[Speaker 1]
To get kava and the Kaaba wasn't kava anymore. Why, what happened? You know, mindwife, yeah. Mine wiped by Men In Black by who Miss Vera

[Speaker 5]
Okay?

[Speaker 3]
Where poor died, and we ran away and gave up.

[Speaker 5]
Oh, trying to say kava,

[Speaker 3]
Yeah,

[Speaker 5]
Mind wiped kava, yeah. So,

[Speaker 2]
The

[Speaker 5]
Boss Mission anyway,

[Speaker 1]
Because this is kind of gross.

[Speaker 4]
Well, we didn't know until I showed up, and I was like, really yelling at her.

[Speaker 5]
Oh,

[Speaker 3]
Okay, it wasn't a well planned shit. So,

[Speaker 5]
Then, now what? What message are we getting from home?

[Speaker 2]
So, kava was the person who is being, uh? Little sequestered. Mine wiped. Yeah, Avondor. About my wife. She realized that these weirdo freaks that burst into her room and started talking about this person that you didn't know. She eventually together that she was mind right there that she has his partner as well.

[Speaker 1]
That's fair. I only just now realized that her plan failed. And that she's probably going to

[Speaker 2]
Retaliate. And that's the end of her message.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, that's. That's horrible. Very cool. So now we're back on back on Westmoreland.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah,

[Speaker 3]
Officially.

[Speaker 1]
It only took one day nice. We'll never be free until we kill

[Speaker 5]
Her. Which will never happen. She's so powerful.

[Speaker 4]
Okay, Megal cat is sending back, saying, I

[Speaker 2]
Believe, you can just say, say, like, oh,

[Speaker 4]
Okay, um, thank you so much, Papa. I'm really sorry that we applied to you and pushed you and just weren't very polite, um. I hope you're safe. Thank you for telling us about that. Uh, good night. Very,

[Speaker 1]
Very corporate answer.

[Speaker 4]
No,

[Speaker 1]
Who knows later, she's lying.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, oh. Oh, I'm so dumb. This has happened before. I didn't want to pick. This is the second time

[Speaker 1]
You're too nice. Robin, you only expect the goodest people. Oh my gosh.

[Speaker 2]
You would never do that. Nice.

[Speaker 1]
Okay.

[Speaker 4]
It's just. I don't even think like that, like, I'm not, like, oh, let me check if it's actually hurts. They can't track. We can get tracks ending like a telephone.

[Speaker 1]
They

[Speaker 3]
Got the they had the police on the line they like. Keep on for this three more seconds. Yeah.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, I hope not,

[Speaker 1]
Hold on, we're triangulating.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, that actually is an answer.

[Speaker 3]
I mean, it looks like we're not being followed by

[Speaker 1]
Anything I didn't say anything.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, unless you and I do retaliating like teleport to kill us.

[Speaker 3]
Talk a big deal. I don't think she's a problem. She's probably fine.

[Speaker 4]
I feel like there's like if she retaliates us out of Pride, but it's like it doesn't have bigger stuff to do. You shouldn't even get the book herself.

[Speaker 3]
How bad would you be? I'm sure we could take her. Never hikes never matter. So, it was like, she's like,

[Speaker 4]
I just hope she lie. Yeah, it's fine, just kill it.

[Speaker 3]
Getting out, like, come on, like those giant cheap things. Like, how is she more scary than the sheep things it smells

[Speaker 4]
She can, like, put her hand up and stop a giant monster, and like, literally, have, yeah, of course. Yeah, so did I, I

[Speaker 1]
Went. Oh, would you like some ice water to cool freaking kill me just by looking at me? Or we're just by saying my words?

[Speaker 1]
Out. That's fair,

[Speaker 4]
Yeah,

[Speaker 2]
It's hot. It's not

[Speaker 1]
What the hell, it's not fair. Will I ever be not? I guess next level. She won't be able to do it,

[Speaker 2]
And now you've lost the only person at your party that you can counter spell.

[Speaker 4]
I can pass Death War. That's it, and I don't know, yeah, so I can meet you guys. Uh, so I know, I think it really kills you, though, right? Like it, doesn't

[Speaker 2]
It? Uh, it insecules it. Yeah,

[Speaker 4]
Like all of it

[Speaker 1]
Doesn't bound you. No, it

[Speaker 2]
Didn't stick it.

[Speaker 5]
Sorry, yeah, wow,

[Speaker 4]
Yeah,

[Speaker 1]
Which

[Speaker 3]
Is spelled that vespara has

[Speaker 5]
Power of death

[Speaker 3]
Power word death. Jesus says the word, and you die word, it fills. Well, yeah, I'll.

[Speaker 2]
Creature. You can see within rage to die instantly. If the creature you choose has 100 hit points or fewer, it dies otherwise. The spell has no effect.

[Speaker 5]
So? Very simple, so Zaba kadabra basically.

[Speaker 1]
Yep.

[Speaker 1]
I feel like if something is coming together here, though I've gotta say, the more items we get, the more things that I believe that we can do. Because with this bubble gut thing, right? I feel like this item is a lot stronger than it looks.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, who cares what the power word kill? We have a bubble gun?

[Speaker 1]
No, but you don't get it, right? Let's say, like, I start to speak when you're on the ground. No, no. But let's say I start first, right? And I shoot her with this guy, and it works right. Dex 20 is a pretty high saving throw, and she

[Speaker 2]
Falls,

[Speaker 1]
And you're next to her with Pace. That's two, three crits back to back to back.

[Speaker 3]
Out, the security is good. Oh wait,

[Speaker 5]
You can

[Speaker 1]
Guarantee your credit if he's like, prone, right. By the way, the

[Speaker 5]
The charge

[Speaker 1]
Is that it? If you're like on the floor, I'm

[Speaker 5]
Sure.

[Speaker 3]
No, it's incapacitated. No,

[Speaker 1]
They're not Pro now. Okay,

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, it

[Speaker 2]
Gives you Advantage. It doesn't give you okay, okay.

[Speaker 5]
My like, my exploding effect is 66 fire damage plus 2D 12, plus two. Crit affects that, plus my original 2d6 plus five. It's part of the damage.

[Speaker 2]
As you guys are kind of planning this out, considering your weapons and your tactics to eventually affect the sparrow. The Knight comes to a relatively peaceful end. Uh, you guys wake up the next morning, and you meet up with Elwood unless there's something that specific that you want to do before you get out.

[Speaker 4]
Um, can Magnuson reflecting and wonder if that was cobbler or not?

[Speaker 2]
Yes, you can, uh, making an insight check okay.

[Speaker 1]
Is there a Vero Station? Do I know

[Speaker 4]
27, 27?

[Speaker 2]
Oh, very nice, uh, you are pretty certain that this was indeed power. Okay.

[Speaker 2]
I would say, probably not. I think Vero stretch is too small to have, uh, presence here in the gone, especially because most of Nagan is is, uh. The world Focused. They're very much into the

[Speaker 1]
My family was the night one. Layla.

[Speaker 3]
I'm a Layla.

[Speaker 2]
There are a few churches. Yeah, we'll say Lele and Luar, and the two main beings. Um. You guys meet up with Elwyn in the next morning. He sets up, uh, kind of an appointment on the edges. Kind of like one of these roads that go to the Shimmer Peak Alps, which are this region of. Uh, sonogan is right here, and a lot of the resources that I get are from these mountains that are next to it, uh, that are called Mission or pickups, and all of you realize why pretty much instantly. Guys, get a good view of these mountains. There's like, almost like a very like glittery, uh, quality to them. That's very similar to the one that you saw in the mud when you arrived here.

[Speaker 2]
As you arrive there, elwin is, uh, you recognized him as well. He recognizes you for some kind of waves, uh, he's disguised as another person. Currently, he's this guy who has like a human, uh, man with, like, a very like, uh, strange

[Speaker 3]
Like

[Speaker 2]
Haircut, a very square kind of thing, um. Well, I'm excited to see what you. Arrive. The promised?

[Speaker 1]
Goods as it were. It's been quite some time friend. I kind of. I, by the way, are you not hold on? And then I, I opened my eyes and I started looking around.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah,

[Speaker 1]
I think I'm stressed.

[Speaker 2]
He goes anyway. Are you not going to, um, meet up with?

[Speaker 1]
I gotta just look at him.

[Speaker 4]
Does she live here?

[Speaker 2]
So a sensitive subject? So I might have said too much anyways. What's the, what's the goods? Can we bring up the goods?

[Speaker 4]
We should go somewhere more secret Outlet.

[Speaker 2]
Is it that big isn't that interesting?

[Speaker 4]
Yeah,

[Speaker 2]
Fantastic. Uh, he leaves you off into kind of like a, a side road that seems to kind of appear into the jungle more. Eventually, you're out of sight out of out of hearing. Well, I'm watching.

[Speaker 4]
On the bag,

[Speaker 1]
Um, pull out the one of the guns and one of the vests and.

[Speaker 2]
Like these little like spectacles. Uh, you see that they're like mechanical in some way, where they actually like seem to adjust, like, just like.

[Speaker 1]
Uh, he

[Speaker 2]
Takes it and he goes. I must have. Let's, uh, put my whole entire life. I've never been more puzzled. As for what something's supposed to do is this? What is this supposed to do?

[Speaker 4]
To spell gun.

[Speaker 2]
Have

[Speaker 4]
Done you. You cast a level of a spell on it, and then it, like, multiple. It's like more damage, like one of those,

[Speaker 2]
Uh. Musket, but with spells yeah? Yeah,

[Speaker 4]
Aren't you another person with magic?

[Speaker 2]
I want to see it experience at all on anywhere else between obviously reasons.

[Speaker 4]
To level one,

[Speaker 3]
You can shoot me if you want.

[Speaker 4]
Okay, it's level one, so I'm gonna shoot right with the gun, so I casted it. And then,

[Speaker 5]
Uh,

[Speaker 3]
I'm also wearing the best, so they can show, like Cynthia's skin, and it just sucks at me that. How do you use that, how it works?

[Speaker 2]
Yeah.

[Speaker 4]
Only if you wait does it when you, we have no

[Speaker 2]
Idea how it works, right?

[Speaker 4]
Yeah,

[Speaker 2]
You kind of know that. It's like sucking, like your magical energy out

[Speaker 4]
Of your smile. Magical, too,

[Speaker 1]
Just for the same thing.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, it only

[Speaker 4]
Pierces us, which is not great, but because we are.

[Speaker 2]
They're taking years to be like, mosquito. No, I don't get bitten by mosquitoes much. I've got curious. Really, yeah, can I show? Can you see the thing? What type of thing? Yeah.

[Speaker 4]
I'm gonna roll.

[Speaker 2]
Wow, it is marketable. Are you selling these?

[Speaker 4]
Or selling them. We're gifting them to you,

[Speaker 2]
Gifting no

[Speaker 4]
Longer. When I was gapped, I meant like, um, like, this is an exclusive offer. Yeah,

[Speaker 1]
We wanted to be compensated, but business partners right. We can get a little bit of discount sure,

[Speaker 2]
And

[Speaker 1]
I

[Speaker 2]
Mean, I did save you a butt that one time, actually. Those many hobbies.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, this is

[Speaker 1]
True. Never

[Speaker 3]
Saved my butt. So,

[Speaker 2]
Hey,

[Speaker 5]
Hey, hey, hey, I

[Speaker 2]
Indeed, do not know this question, uh.

[Speaker 1]
No, yeah, we met in Edgar.

[Speaker 5]
I've heard

[Speaker 2]
Of Silverstone, but I, I don't remember. Oh, yes, yes, you were. They had an avondor. Yes, that's nice to meet you again. Nice to see you. Um,

[Speaker 1]
Have you met this guy? I, I have a mess about the GPS. He is currently a child.

[Speaker 5]
Do you know where to put him?

[Speaker 2]
There's a lot of questions in a short amount of Spanish,

[Speaker 1]
All right. Hold on, uh?

[Speaker 4]
This

[Speaker 1]
Thing you are holding, we found in some kind of ruins of what seemed to be an ancient civilization. They spoke a different language. We found a Titan inside of the ruins comma series might have been up to something. Uh, don't remember her theories,

[Speaker 2]
But perhaps?

[Speaker 1]
Did

[Speaker 2]
You remember she was saying that there was some kind of ancient civilization that they were far more events and all that? Yeah, sure,

[Speaker 1]
Whatever? Anyways, we found this gun. We found these armor we found a Titan and?

[Speaker 3]
He's green, is

[Speaker 2]
It? It's a bit of rocks or sorta

[Speaker 4]
Yeah. You can stand on it. Can you give me a

[Speaker 2]
Map specifically where that type is? The exact coordinates

[Speaker 5]
Can any of us do that? Do we like that?

[Speaker 1]
Really good, but I don't think we want to.

[Speaker 2]
Are you asking me,

[Speaker 4]
What would you do if you could mean a tiding? Theoretically, what are you gonna, and what are you gonna do? Well,

[Speaker 2]
Okay, let's say, theoretically speaking, that this type. The possibilities are endless. First of all? Let's focus. I am a man with certain. Principles. And I do, and I still do think. That the invasion of aega should be stopped. Can you believe that sincerely? My first step would be to determine whether or not they can be used in any potential way to fend off against respirator and hold that whole shit. This

[Speaker 1]
Is why we're handing you this the gun.

[Speaker 2]
So, I assume, you know, totally okay with me disabling it, replicating it and selling it.

[Speaker 1]
We have several fantastic.

[Speaker 4]
Maybe don't sell it.

[Speaker 2]
Don't sell it. We don't know that

[Speaker 1]
Anybody else has ever come across something like this before.

[Speaker 4]
This is kind of last. Like, worst case scenario, you arm, a bunchier friends. We

[Speaker 1]
Found what seemed to be an Armory, and we took everything that was inside. Say,

[Speaker 2]
Theoretically speaking, that we knew for a fact that the other opposing. Continent was also developing their own etheric weapons.

[Speaker 4]
Was stopping you from accidentally selling this to them.

[Speaker 2]
Make sure that it's within the confine of the angrier continent. All I'm saying is, I mean, if some sure Empire is going to do it, we should do it as well. As we know for the fact that that's the case, right? Babies we might as well kill babies ourselves, right? It definitely can get to what she gets it. Excuse me.

[Speaker 1]
I,

[Speaker 2]
I'm just saying, I'm just throwing ideas out there. I'm not, I'm quite a specialist.

[Speaker 1]
Acre is safe. That is all I care about. I

[Speaker 2]
Can try and deal with that. As for your Titan question, I mean, first, I would try to understand whether it's useful in any way, and if it's not, then maybe.

[Speaker 2]
Mind the kind of made of rocks

[Speaker 4]
Made of probably like fellows.

[Speaker 2]
Themselves. Well, that shit is very right. Anyways, I'll have to think about it, but if you could give me the location that I can stop thinking about it, I don't think we

[Speaker 3]
Should get in the location. I think we should. The guns can help protect anger. The Titan seems like, now that's a nuke, you know?

[Speaker 2]
Um.

[Speaker 1]
Furthermore. We found the Dragon Rider in the Book of Genesis. Fantastic. That's

[Speaker 2]
Good news. So, have you? Is that all sealed now? Is that all done? That's where I can't get to it. It seems to be

[Speaker 1]
Taken care of. Um,

[Speaker 2]
It's a great step. I mean, especially considering that we're now, like, three days away from her initial dates. Thanks to you, it seems like they're not ready to have made it all.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, I think we, we tampered with our plans a little bit.

[Speaker 2]
That's fantastic video and give us all more time, but now,

[Speaker 1]
Um, some of the agarians of the psychology. Yeah, but now none of us know what to do.

[Speaker 2]
Well, if you bought yourself some time. Know that no plan has been fought at this point.

[Speaker 5]
Probably

[Speaker 2]
Not. Yes. Well, she's going to look for other options. Do you know of any other options that she has?

[Speaker 1]
Not that I'm aware of.

[Speaker 2]
You have any way of gardening information from the inside.

[Speaker 1]
We could go back. We have

[Speaker 3]
A we do have an inside hookup

[Speaker 4]
Though now.

[Speaker 1]
I

[Speaker 4]
Guess I could talk to Kaaba.

[Speaker 1]
We don't know this yet, right? It's only you

[Speaker 4]
I, you can say, Meg told you guys last night as soon as it happened. She probably ran over and was, like, guess it,

[Speaker 2]
Yeah.

[Speaker 4]
I feel a little dubious about asking her for help when she went get her mind erased. She's caught, but that's the reason to blow some. She's like.

[Speaker 1]
Compass layer that we would reunite them. So, maybe implicating her this early? May not be the best decision.

[Speaker 2]
Well. Yeah, you know what they say about homeless eggs?

[Speaker 2]
Do not know particularly. More information about any of you do, but if you have a way to get information from the inside, you shall probably use that. I understand your ethic, open science. Um, but you also. Know that vispera is going to be looking for another option. It's just about figuring out what that option is, yeah. And stuff like that. I mean, there are a few things right. We can imagine that. Uh, in one case, she just ignores the fact that she doesn't have this teleportation Circle and just chooses to go by, both which is.

[Speaker 2]
I don't particularly leave. That's for Sparrow style. I think that she's far too conservative to ever do something that rash. Because I would give us a great advantage, obviously. Or she finds another way to find the information that's in the book. Have any of you read it? Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
I think I read it.

[Speaker 3]
Do you like?

[Speaker 1]
No,

[Speaker 2]
You've reddits

[Speaker 1]
No?

[Speaker 3]
I think so. If you like, read it, and then mind, wipe yourself.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, I mean,

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, I mean, we? I don't think I mean the original plan was for me adorabledom to make like a one-time password type of encryption, right for it?

[Speaker 5]
OTP.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, we're like, I think what we wanted to do was, like, I read it. And then, like, we used like a feed scope to, like, like, read, basically rewrite the book and like, like, an encryption, and then he might wipes me constantly while I'm rewriting the book.

[Speaker 5]
Whoa, I

[Speaker 1]
Don't think we'll finish. Yeah,

[Speaker 2]
He's in a match official. Yeah.

[Speaker 2]
Encrypted

[Speaker 1]
Version of the teleportation Circle, but you don't have the key. No, I do have the key. You do have it. Yeah. Just don't. I, like, I haven't read it. I haven't read anything. Okay, okay, yeah, wow. Is honestly an incredibly smart, um. She goes. Oh, or he goes. That's. That's good. That's good. If you don't have the information that even if she kills him, she won't be able to get it. Are there any other people that she could get this information from? I mean, do you even know who wrote these books? I don't remember it's supposed to be the Wayne Walker.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, was the plane walker. Right, that was the plane Walker. We met another. Assyria. One of the original one of the Wonder Kids. Yes, the Dragon Rider. Oh, he was one of them. He was one of them. That makes sense, I guess. He must have been the first one, and I guess we have knowledge of another first and last.

[Speaker 1]
Excuse me, we have knowledge of another. The order of the black Sun. Also, one of those streaks, Zeke, his name. And they're all siblings. It's very. There were lots of them as far as we're concerned, and I assume that's not biological, right? That's we couldn't say, oh, obviously, not he.

[Speaker 1]
I don't think he or he even knew yeah, or he remembered, but. Is that all different braces as well, right? Yeah, that would be kind of weird, unless those freaked out of, like, a different way of producing or something. All this is like, outside of the conversation. Should we tell them about the doomsday device magic nuke bomb that is too much information?

[Speaker 5]
Well, I feel like that's the those are the objective bad. Guys like Chris Spear is bad, but like, or Alexa is, like, bad, bad. Oh yeah.

[Speaker 1]
I mean, he is. He's the only one who might know anything about this, he just. He's like the biggest magician we have wizard, right? He's a wizard. Does he have anything you do not know what the source of his power is? We knew he was a wizard.

[Speaker 2]
I'll record. Um. All right, I guess we kind of.

[Speaker 1]
Can we just like lay down the information about the whole magic and the yeah, yeah?

[Speaker 2]
Uh, he goes. Is planning to erase automatic. That's the idea, I think. Well, that took me the Revolutionary one harrowing.

[Speaker 1]
I think it's the word.

[Speaker 2]
I mean, I obviously biased, because yeah, um. Well, that seems quite rash for sure. We don't have any assurances as to whether this will actually like, not kill us all and all that,

[Speaker 4]
You know, there's a thousand percent will kill us all, okay. And then they, but they won't listen to you, though.

[Speaker 2]
Well, uh, yes, it seems like that was a good idea, uh, from my experience here, from the contacts that I've had with, uh, the various, uh? Uh, persons involved in vehicle in kind of information scene. It does seem like a lot of the audience of blacks and all operatives do, in fact, operate an egg, uh, how exactly that is done is unclear.

[Speaker 2]
I have not managed to actually get anyone into the organization or haven't met on the inside or anything like that. They are very stressed

[Speaker 10]
To know where they gather, so we may kidnap one and interrogate them. Well,

[Speaker 2]
Do you remember how we? Well, not the bee, but the.

[Speaker 2]
Of the operatives. All in there. I'll have the thing that my guess is, they're probably doing something similar, but maybe even more extreme because I've tried to describe on, uh, some operatives that I knew were involved with it, and I could not find them

[Speaker 4]
Same. I'm sorry

[Speaker 5]
That also happened to me. I tried to look for Lucius, and it was just like nothing exactly. So, um, where was Lucius? Options to that.

[Speaker 2]
As someone who has had to avoid describing many times, uh, either you have one of these, and you kind of like takes a tenant off his chest, and you're like something like that. Magical, yeah, Auntie of such a thing.

[Speaker 1]
Can we have one going on? These aren't very expensive,

[Speaker 3]
How expensive

[Speaker 5]
You know, like, almost as expensive as a a weapon that is beyond the scope of anything has ever been seen before, certainly not as expensive.

[Speaker 2]
Even if you did have the money, I don't know if I could gone enough of that money, but I can definitely get your piece something that would be really nice.

[Speaker 5]
Anyways, my point was, um, either the necklace or even the necklace or.

[Speaker 1]
An incredible amount of very specific materials that are encasing you, um, I believe lead, was one of them. The other is actually, and he points to, uh, the mountains. Then he goes, uh, zygonize. This is one of them as well. So recently, disco property. I don't know if you've been.

[Speaker 1]
In on? Attack, but Something that your father was involved in, I believe. New ether that has been discovered? In Vega recently in the last 10 years or so. The climate property that it's deflective.

[Speaker 2]
I'm almost like, almost like Shield some sense. Also protect you. That what's? Touch it because Leola has an operation for a very long time, and this thing is very unique unless they had some kind of inside information. It's probably possible, and third option is a pocket player population. Oh, what?

[Speaker 2]
The same kind that is coming down. Oh, he's back. Yeah, uh, oh, I believe, the place that we went to altogether, uh? I can't believe we lost that tuning Fork.

[Speaker 1]
How does one find?

[Speaker 10]
A pocket Dimension without. We

[Speaker 1]
Had a tuning fork and we lost it. Well, that was was his favorite, not for it to no.

[Speaker 5]
Where the black Suns

[Speaker 3]
Did we get a key, or how do we first enter? Was it through the tuning park, but we made our own tuning board? Yeah, no, I mean, Vespara gave us the. Cool! That was a scroll, but then we made the tuning fork while we were there to get back, but then.

[Speaker 3]
Boar died with a tuned four, yeah. Tell

[Speaker 5]
You everything, except that

[Speaker 1]
Except it wasn't actual. It was just a plain Fork, so maybe he was? I wonder what they do with his body? Oh wait, we had his body, right? No, yeah, we did not have his body. Well, she, she just wrapped his bite. The neck, like a dog, and that was the last new song.

[Speaker 1]
We could go

[Speaker 4]
Undercover and try to join. I have seaming. Oh, it allows everyone in the group to be in it. Like, it look different, and it lasts eight hours. And the save is 17, and I think they have to touch you. I think it's like the same rules as the one like that the sky self, but it's just for everybody.

[Speaker 10]
Damn, because we wanted to do what was option one again with the necklace?

[Speaker 2]
But again, as I mentioned, this is pretty rare. Inexpensive item, so if all of them had it, it would be incredibly expensive. I don't have to think they have the needs for that. Maybe some of the upper?

[Speaker 2]
Most likely the option is number three. If you always ask me. Find the pocket Dimension. That's right, but that's which is how? But that's the problem. Don't follow somebody here. We could join the order of the blacks. How about? And then, eventually.

[Speaker 5]
Somebody has to open the door to these portals to these pockets. Yeah, with you, sorry. Is Phineas there with you? Yeah, okay.

[Speaker 2]
Goes well. Maybe if we can observe,

[Speaker 1]
Wait, this video still around this. It's a waving the house. Yeah, especially because he needs to meet Alvin. Yeah, that's true. Well, maybe if we can observe someone casting it, we can try and determine what the place is like, if they oh. Well, they have to have something attuned to that place to go there themselves, right?

[Speaker 1]
So, if we can intercept whoever that is and take?

[Speaker 1]
Do you see where I'm getting it? Yes, we have thought of that, but we don't know who has what?

[Speaker 5]
Or if they have it at all. Well, if we get a high enough ranking member of the order, they're going to have probably

[Speaker 1]
A way to get into the flock of Dimension, right? Are you guys just like, find somebody and we could identify someone try to track one down? And it does. That's reasonable. Let's do it.

[Speaker 3]
Also, Phineas mean Alvin. This guy's so smart, really good magic. Ask which questions you have. They meet each other a lot of role. Play two people meeting each other. To himself. We're just there, like.

[Speaker 2]
Nice to meet you. Phyllis, uh, nice to meet you, sir Ellen, uh, and baby each other, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, uh, they talk about magic and all that. How about? Is there anything else I can help you with? I mean, we obviously still need to complete this transaction, but as far as information goes, does that help?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah,

[Speaker 2]
What's the plan? Is it to kill them all? Yeah, so I think we know, yeah, yeah. 100, yes, kill them, probably Zeke.

[Speaker 3]
Might have to go now. The

[Speaker 2]
Blob of Flesh. Yeah,

[Speaker 3]
He saw him right

[Speaker 2]
To my perfect. You mentioned that

[Speaker 5]
I think our main goal is to stop the bomb.

[Speaker 2]
That's a good idea.

[Speaker 3]
Also, learn how the flesh is alive

[Speaker 2]
To blow up, kill them all. That's one option, certainly something

[Speaker 5]
That's not a primary role. It's like a side class that's. As for extra credit, that's yeah. Yeah.

[Speaker 5]
Um, it's more of a personal.

[Speaker 1]
Side news. We became some of the greatest hunters that they occur in wildlands have ever seen.

[Speaker 2]
Oh fantastic, Jimmy facts.

[Speaker 1]
Oh man, I love Max. He's so funny, he is quite a character. Uh, he is

[Speaker 2]
Extremely good at business. I think his Iron Bulldog really helps that, yes,

[Speaker 1]
He cried, and

[Speaker 4]
We wouldn't give him the guns. Oh yeah, that makes sense. He, he really likes weapons.

[Speaker 10]
So, how do we go about finding an operative and a high enough ranking one at that

[Speaker 1]
At the same time

[Speaker 2]
That you don't get noticed. All guilds as you damage them as well. Remember, I

[Speaker 1]
Think Megan and I will be able to handle that pretty well. Yeah,

[Speaker 10]
You guys are really high deception, right? So

[Speaker 5]
Have I, I?

[Speaker 10]
I'm pretty good at this time.

[Speaker 2]
It's probably enough after tests. Here's my issue with this whole thing. I've tried to get to that point.

[Speaker 2]
To observe that or suspicious of someone, and we follow them around and whatever. Uh, generally, those people end up dead. So, be careful, but you all all?

[Speaker 1]
Wait, who ends up that the people who's following them or the people who are being followed,

[Speaker 2]
Not the people who are following them.

[Speaker 10]
Oh well, that's fine. Well, they

[Speaker 3]
Said the same thing about people who go to the the Great Wild

[Speaker 2]
West. Yeah, there's all significantly stronger than the vast majority of my operatives at this point. So

[Speaker 4]
Well, you've operated. Oh,

[Speaker 1]
Of course, he does.

[Speaker 1]
Exactly. Friends in the right places. Okay, let's talk business, shall we? I'm just going to reply for these things, and do you wish anything in exchange? And also, how many of them am I getting?

[Speaker 2]
How many do I have? Am I getting the right to the patents or the intellectual properties? Oh, the white. Oh, we have one, two, three, four.

[Speaker 1]
Five, six, seven, eight, nine, like, twenty, twelve. Guns. I have one gun as well, and like several vests like what 12 Fest. Hey, what's what deaths are these anti-ether vests? Oh, not, great brains. Yeah, um.

[Speaker 3]
I think I should give him one third, because what if we do need to outfit for some reason? A group of people I was gonna say we give them three, right? Oh, it's even better. Yeah. For a while, like a thousand gold.

[Speaker 1]
Two thousand gold raises because a thousand gold. What's a good price, the price, huh? Yeah, that's the price.

[Speaker 2]
Could I for unknown technology? I don't know if it's cheap. How about? Are you guys in town for much longer?

[Speaker 5]
How about for now? I buy one of them.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, I'll buy one of them. And then, depending on, I'll send it to some person who knows how to deal with these things and can check that this is in fact as revolutionary, it seems. And then, depending on those results, I can buy album later. Yeah, one for 500, then.

[Speaker 2]
Business. He. We don't have to go through, like, the process of coming back on. How much are you willing to sell it tonight, huh? How much are you willing to sell to?

[Speaker 1]
Oh, yeah, it's like Pawn Stars. I'm gonna have a guy look at it, and he comes back. All I can do is 50 gold.

[Speaker 2]
That just because he's a very careful businessman, so he would check that it is in fact worth his money, but 500 gold for a piece seems a decent type. So how much are you? How many are you willing to stop now?

[Speaker 1]
Two for a thousand. Okay, so one thousand five hundred? That a good price, I don't

[Speaker 4]
Know. I feel like it's way too cheap, because every time we went shopping, we couldn't afford anything. I

[Speaker 1]
Mean, we sold a pirate like an entire ship for 500 gold at one time, right? Was that five?

[Speaker 4]
Oh yeah, that was 500.

[Speaker 1]
It was like 5, 000. It wasn't five thousand. We never had five thousand.

[Speaker 4]
Wait, it's got to be five thousand because I have 300 you have like something, and I

[Speaker 5]
Had I have plate armor is worth fifteen hundred gold.

[Speaker 4]
See, that's yeah. That's how I'm looking at it.

[Speaker 3]
What the fuck? I think if you can make.

[Speaker 1]
Uh, sailing ship is ten thousand gold.

[Speaker 2]
Your characters. Idea of what gold is worth compared to then 3, 000 a piece. Right, four thousand a piece? I don't know. 3000 I think double plate armors 30, 3, 500, 3500, okay, we're happy with ourselves right now. How about two thousand a piece? No, I know, absolutely not.

[Speaker 2]
Two thousand?

[Speaker 1]
Three thousand three thousand final offer two thousand five hundred three thousand final offer.

[Speaker 2]
Are there any actions that you're particularly interested in getting?

[Speaker 10]
Yes, flight armor?

[Speaker 4]
No, no,

[Speaker 1]
I think, dude, it's 18

[Speaker 4]
AC for 15,

[Speaker 1]
000 gold

[Speaker 4]
Off the title. Oh, are

[Speaker 2]
You proficient in heavy armor anyways? Oh,

[Speaker 1]
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, I mean,

[Speaker 10]
What do

[Speaker 1]
We need? We need a sneak right? We need it. We need to not be able to be tracked. I

[Speaker 5]
Did our base.

[Speaker 2]
Have, I think I haven't died. I'll throw in one more portion of haste, and so you were saying how much three thousand per piece? Three eight thousand pushing paste. Potion of haste is not worth a thousand gold.

[Speaker 1]
You're a terrible haggler.

[Speaker 1]
The amulet sounds. It could be good, but we could also find it, yeah, or steal it.

[Speaker 5]
What if we just scaled something right now? No,

[Speaker 1]
I'm gonna stop

[Speaker 10]
You right there. He has quite literally our most stable Ally in this entire campaign fine.

[Speaker 2]
Guys. Yeah, these are like oldie allies.

[Speaker 4]
He's our only friends. They literally are only literally are

[Speaker 1]
Actually. No, there's layout. She's kind of chill with us, even though we didn't have her and tore her from her life and put her into a like child's care

[Speaker 2]
8500 for the lot

[Speaker 1]
For the. How much for the loss than three dots eight thousand five hundred and you give him the haze potion?

[Speaker 3]
Folks is only 500 gold Max.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, what was the final price

[Speaker 4]
8500 eight thousand

[Speaker 2]
Eight

[Speaker 1]
Thousand five hundred? Sure,

[Speaker 2]
Just a little discount for friends, you know, it

[Speaker 4]
Makes. It makes all the gold we, we, I like, harder, and gold completely trivial. It is, I never harder than any of my gold.

[Speaker 3]
Check out, uh, we sell three guns for eight thousand five hundred gold. Is, like, how many platform is that? Uh, 850. Yeah, I believe one Platinum is 10 gold. Yeah. Get robbed. You guys

[Speaker 2]
Are fucking! Great! You guys are

[Speaker 1]
Amazing, not according to like, and yeah, Alan is very rich. Sandy care cost is so fucking crazy, especially spell. What about the antiquito vest? Should we sell those to him? Yeah, yeah, I think the end to either best went out, right? We have so many of them. Yeah, like three.

[Speaker 1]
I think those ones are less good.

[Speaker 2]
But you seem less interesting,

[Speaker 1]
They are less interesting. They're like, kind of worthless, to be honest, at least us. What does it do resistance to cold, fire, lightning, radiant, and thunder damage from Magic sources. Yeah, only managing is a thing. Yeah. I guess it could be reconstructed into something more useful, so there's value in that.

[Speaker 1]
I can have my guy look at it.

[Speaker 3]
You know what we should give him more than have his guy look at it, and then they can make it better like increase the AC on.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, that is true.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, exactly. Maybe you can weave it to some actual option. Yeah.

[Speaker 3]
Then, that's like we could do a patent kind of thing, or, or like, an agreement. Like, when you upgrade this, you have to give us like contract making deals, no. For building a business here. Wow, why not? He was part of the soft spot he is. Yeah, how about that deal?

[Speaker 1]
We give you this, this armor, and if we are able to make it into something better, we would like a steep discount on whatever you make with these anti-eatherrests. I don't, it sounds reasonable.

[Speaker 5]
If we're going to experiment on these,

[Speaker 1]
I'd rather have the majority of them. In fact, as many as possible?

[Speaker 5]
How about four of them or five of them?

[Speaker 1]
That's the majority five of them for two thousand gold. And how much would you sell them back to us for? If you were in Jamaica, it depends on the price it takes to actually make.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, I'll just give you half of what it costs to make. Whoa, okay! Half of class of goods sold. Okay, yeah. Trick hands.

[Speaker 1]
So amazing! An extra 2000 gold

[Speaker 2]
In your pocket. You officially now have enough

[Speaker 5]
Cash to destroy up by a boat. That's not nearly as much as I thought for selling experimental Warfare. Like, I feel like we should be like. Well, that is a lot of goals.

[Speaker 3]
Sure. Now you only sold three. A boat is very expensive.

[Speaker 2]
Uh, and you're dealing with someone who is not buying it at a total price. And it's worth, I feel like underground deal. Okay, he knows that you're the only person that he can sell this to. Let's talk

[Speaker 4]
About investing if we buy a boat and then lease it to ship cargo. We're gonna make ten thousand ten thousand gold back within a month. We could just retire now and be Pirates, whatever.

[Speaker 4]
Other continent, and they'd be like, yeah, let's choose a continent and away from Busteria campaign over.

[Speaker 2]
So, with ten thousand gold, you are millionaires. Now you have a million dollars in cash. That's nothing.

[Speaker 4]
That's your camera. One of us can retire, and it's

[Speaker 1]
Like, what, like a thousand A.D, so inflate that? Oh,

[Speaker 4]
We're quadrillionaires,

[Speaker 2]
Like, today's money. Yeah, never

[Speaker 4]
Mind, we're not diversion. We're not that rich.

[Speaker 2]
Hey, a million is is still not bad. Yeah, a million dollar Rich. She's a lucky guy.

[Speaker 2]
Like, man, you guys throws Hemlock too much. Boots. Yeah. Life fancy. He has leather boots I just like, like small and gold.

[Speaker 6]
All right. Come back. You got a gold chain and a perco. And he's, like, guys. The money's gone. I got robbed guys. I I smile. It feels like real.

[Speaker 2]
Dude, a Dragonborn girl would go crazy hard.

[Speaker 3]
You're allowed to get that for all. The work you put in to get us,

[Speaker 6]
Yeah, take one. Take one gold away. Officially have a gold tooth and you kind of want to get a grill. I still have like the Ray-Bans on. Yeah, yeah.

[Speaker 5]
Order of the black fucking son.

[Speaker 2]
Find the order of the black side, I guess, kill them all if that's what you want.

[Speaker 5]
Yes,

[Speaker 2]
I do not personally have any gripes of that. If you can't do that, though, it, in fact, because that would mostly kill the argument that the shoe Empire has full invade in this place anyways, which has actually stopped him, I'm guessing. No, but yes. War regardless. In a few days, it's just that now it will take.

[Speaker 2]
Significant amount, more time to actually get troops. Here we have a window. All

[Speaker 5]
That matters, all right where the fuck do we find the black Sun where you have operatives explain

[Speaker 7]
Them in the past. Surely, you know, some major really events.

[Speaker 2]
They are very elusive. However, I would recommend hanging out around. The CD bars and the swamp. And eventually, you should be able to notice, uh, well, again again. In all members of the order of the Black Sun are identifiable with the tattoo that is invisible until you cast a spell on it.

[Speaker 2]
I do not know this spell, however. This is what enables them to actually confirm that they are orders of the website. Other, they are members. Notice someone casting a spell while they're touching someone like shaking the hand or something along those lines. Interesting. Shall we spread out?

[Speaker 5]
Or yeah, I'm doing it now. I'll leave that up to you, uh. Good luck. Updates me.

[Speaker 2]
And fantastic work out there. Yeah, you have successfully delayed the invasion of aeger by at least a few weeks. I would assume.

[Speaker 1]
Hell yeah, healthy. Hell yeah, yeah, the first and special thing we've done and this fucking campaign. The first, truly good thing. Yeah, yeah, like, like, like, good, good, like, lawful, good kind of?

[Speaker 4]
Good job, and he leaves with his three guns, and like he puts it into a bucket plane with his own little actually.

[Speaker 2]
What do you guys do? Are you guys looking now for, uh, black order of the sun operative? Yeah, either either people who are.

[Speaker 6]
Shady as hell, or people who are shaking hands cancer cells. Okay, like, do you have a pocket Dimension? You used to right when you were? When you were playing as a rogue, remember?

[Speaker 3]
No, I don't remember,

[Speaker 2]
You might be referencing the poem that she had from the underbelly, but this, no, she

[Speaker 1]
Had, like, remember when she used to steal stuff she had, like a pop Dimension that she used to put him into at the very, very beginning of her character, at least. Remember that, but anyways, doesn't matter. I don't know. I do not remember that, yeah.

[Speaker 2]
Where's a safe place? We can keep the rest because we still have one, two, three, four, five, six armors, and. How do you make a pocket universe? Is this spell? He has no clue pocket dimensions are wow at mysterious. It is.

[Speaker 9]
Difficult piece of magic. Yeah, eight guys and five armors.

[Speaker 1]
At least I do. I don't know if you guys have more back on one gun. It would be smart to figure out how to make a pocket plane. Of our own. Yeah, right, you guys can ask some of the. Source errors around you or Wizards. You can ask Phineas, you can ask.

[Speaker 1]
Some, you know, some persons in the libraries or whatever, and by finding out? Does anyone want to investigate that? I think I would. Okay, we can investigation check.

[Speaker 1]
21 come on!

[Speaker 2]
You ask around, you ask Phineas, then you do your own research at the libraries. You find someone who kind of knows their stuff more or less at like a university, uh, it takes a while for you to figure out, like, what's real. What's not? It seems like. Mostly a lot of the pocket planes kind of related items.

[Speaker 2]
Uh. Things that have been? Maybe potentially now that you already know this are actually artifacts from? That's the relationship that you saw earlier. A significant amount of them are the ones that aren't involved a significant amount of. Uh, spell casting resources. Time. It is very difficult to make. Okay.

[Speaker 2]
Possible, but very difficult. You know that the ashir Empire is probably? And specifically avador, like the one of the only places where you get commercially get some of them, like, absolutely. Just like a standalone item?

[Speaker 1]
You can buy it. I think you have like a really, really rough. One would be kind of cool, like if we all had a tuning fork or whatever, and we had like this, just like, just like one room or whatever we could go to. And then, just like, dump a bunch of shit there.

[Speaker 1]
Able to? Not worry about.

[Speaker 5]
Whatever, the hell. What's the worry, you think you'd die and lose it? No, I guess it's just like being. Trapped. Or whatnot.

[Speaker 1]
Being sprayed on. Someone could just grab a bag, and now they have guns. Yeah. I mean, they still, they could just get the tuning fork and get in, but at least that's like a layer.

[Speaker 4]
Unrelated to 12, I thought it sucks.

[Speaker 5]
Meanwhile, can I make a perception check for people who are shaking hands casting cells? I'll do both perception

[Speaker 1]
And Arcana.

[Speaker 2]
It would be investigation. This is an investigative Pursuit, for sure.

[Speaker 1]
Would a good Arcana role help my investigation? Shall I roll that one? No, no, because it's not like it. It's

[Speaker 2]
Pretty clear what's happening when someone cast a spell you don't finish. I'll say perception or investigation. Yeah, well.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, so my investigation wouldn't hold a form. My perception rules of 20? Okay, um, after, uh? I'll say a few days.

[Speaker 2]
The morning of? An announcement is made that Aeger is officially at war with the ishir Empire. Um, it is a big hubbub. There is a lot of people who are scared. Uh, it's you know anything everyone is talking about? Uh, the same day you notice that there are a few figures who at first you do not think anything of.

[Speaker 2]
Um, and kind of just like we're looking into the crowd you're trying to figure out, like who these people are. But you notice that two people who originally seem pretty innocent one of them just puts a hand on the other one's shoulder and with their left hand, they start casting a very small spell, and you notice that, like, just a little bit of black ink starts to drip out of the left hand of the person that's being touched.

[Speaker 2]
Is

[Speaker 1]
Everyone is every is, is, you're by yourself,

[Speaker 2]
You're I assume you're all kind of divided, and you have to look. I'll follow by

[Speaker 5]
Myself,

[Speaker 2]
You follow, uh, make a soft triangle perfect. Good way for my own solo self fashion.

[Speaker 5]
You successfully. Stuff from them.

[Speaker 2]
Uh, and you were not seeing you follow them. Eventually, they go into a back corner, and uh. They start casting a spell there as they're starting to. You recognize it as like a teleportation spell, more or less the same kind of spell that you cast to get into the pocket plane, where, uh Vesperia, instructed you to go.

[Speaker 2]
You see one of them holding, uh, kind of this, like? Uh, looks like almost like a. A heart almost. And they crush it in their hand before. There's like just a little bit of blood dripping out. And data space.

[Speaker 1]
Like, can I see if it's kind of like a poof of smoke? Is it a? Is it like a like a zip like a Teleport? Just like a club of smoke, have a smoke you go. There you inspect it and you see that

[Speaker 2]
Kind of drop of blood that was dropped there. It's kind of, like, Inky black very slightly like purple color, uh, that reminds me of, like, a very, very like arterial. To blow it on this. Okay.

[Speaker 5]
I will. Yeah, I have a glass shower with me. Yeah, may I take a sample of that. Yeah, take a sample, okay? Uh, that I'm assuming I can meet up with them at night. Down. Um. And I will share my findings. I will share that I have successfully followed what appears to be whatever the Black's son.

[Speaker 5]
Have ink that appear when the spell that checks them is cast. And then they will then go to a secretive location. Crush some sort of artifact. And this appearance of spoke. The artifact causes blood.

[Speaker 1]
The trip, and it's very condensed, and I show them this happened. So? Yeah, I was very close. I have, no, I, I was hoped. I was actually hoping that if there was a Teleport ring, I would just I would. I would have just jumped in. Hours. I would have just done it.

[Speaker 1]
I would have done it, but it was like. But no?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, Phineas. What do you think he just gladly takes it? Um, he studies it for a little bit, and he goes well. This is definitely blood, but it's very uh, etherically charged it's very potent. He said. It looked like a heart. Yeah. I wonder what kind of part it was?

[Speaker 1]
Oh, you think it was an actual like someone's actual heart, or do you think it's just an artifact shape, like what? Know, but if it's a heart and it's bleeding.

[Speaker 2]
Maybe we could. Yeah, I guess so, maybe we

[Speaker 1]
Could find another person and then get a heart like before they they crush it. Yeah, yeah, now we know we have to. Yeah, we have to get to him before they crush him.

[Speaker 3]
They come back, but they have to come back in the same spot. Do we think should we like camp it out? Movie trap at the spot. Maybe

[Speaker 1]
I'm happy to do that. I've gone. I've got dog vision. I will, uh, I will. I will stay in that spot. The whole day. It's kind of that spot for the whole night, um.

[Speaker 2]
I don't think they come back to that same as that spot, right? It's not like a teleportation Circle. Their free guitar helper in and out! Okay for me, please, and then choose not to reappear there. For security,

[Speaker 1]
Obvious reasons. Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, you wait there for a single period, amount of time, but the develop, you have to come back. All right guys, we spread out again. We look for the heart, and we intercept it, get the heart back, and we all good. We all teleport here.

[Speaker 2]
Before you guys kind of go out on this Quest to actually intercept someone teleporting to the order of the button. Is there anything else that you want us to do? Didn't have gone before. Because the moment that you guys appear in this pocket Dimension is going to be, it's going to be a fuck Fest.

[Speaker 2]
It was definitely going to be next to every beat as well. So before that, is there anything else anymore? I want to see your.

[Speaker 1]
I think I'm going to sneak off at night. Yeah, do we do? Yeah, that's the question I was about to ask. Do we know if you're sneaking off. Um, no, I'm not gonna tell anyone sweet. Okay, uh, do a role perception fine. No, no, it's fine. I'll leave it.

[Speaker 1]
I can do it. Okay, sounds good. We'll make this fine. 28 yeah.

[Speaker 5]
Well, if you roll the natural one, that would have been that would have been pretty good. Yeah. Uh, there's a three.

[Speaker 1]
I think Vegas fast asleep, which is not even true.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, I wouldn't. I wouldn't think he's gonna do anything. Like, if I heard a noise. It was I or

[Speaker 1]
Hemlock wants to go look at his home.

[Speaker 1]
Start walking throughout your town. How?

[Speaker 2]
You can describe how Hemlock appeared to your friends earlier. But how does everyone feel about walking through his town, especially once it gets closer to where his original domicide was?

[Speaker 1]
I think confusion is the biggest thing the longest time Hemlock thought that he lost both of his parents and then only recently did he find out that his mother was alive.

[Speaker 2]
I guess the only person that really knows is Meg, right?

[Speaker 1]
There you have a mom. Yeah, yeah.

[Speaker 1]
And. And yeah, he is scared. He is also angry, uh, at his mom, because he feels that, how could she not have looked for him because he he's been alive all this time, and it's it feels like she hasn't even tried. So he's angry and confused and sad and hurt at the same time.

[Speaker 1]
But, but he also cannot help themselves. He has to go to sleep. It's this morbid curiosity like this green fire as as consumed as life. It's, it destroyed his home when he was 16, and then it has followed him all the way to ashear and all the way around the world, no matter where he went.

[Speaker 1]
This green fire has chased him, and he has chased this green fire. And now, he knows so much about it. He can finally go home and see, like, at least maybe he'll find another clue that he hasn't seen before.

[Speaker 2]
You walk to where your previous home lives rain starts pouring, then they're gone. There is this sense of? Uh, uncertainty and anxiety and almost exciting as well. That builds up. You feel kind of that adrenaline start to pump as you get closer, and you remember walking out of this place, walking and running far away from what was probably an event that you stole the number to this day very vividly.

[Speaker 2]
You walk to where your previous home was, and you find another one. This place has been rebuilt from the ground up,

[Speaker 1]
A

[Speaker 2]
Place that you do not recognize as a home anymore. Building looks different. Um, it was once kind of this small home small house that was built out of the surrounding Woods. They had a little bit of charm to it, but now it's. Made out of stone, slightly taller. It's a different place.

[Speaker 2]
It's been a very long time. Can I take a look inside

[Speaker 1]
Through the window like carefully and

[Speaker 2]
Peer through the window? Not a problem for a road of your level. You see?

[Speaker 1]
A figure there.

[Speaker 2]
Who seems to be knitting something, and you recognize one mother. Who is kind of this? Like, green Dragonborn, older woman, uh, the scales have seemed to almost fade. From Perez, she has not submitted the older she is shorted to remember her. She is a little bit chubbier than me remember her.

[Speaker 2]
Living there. She used to be doing something you'd be like a hat or something along those lines, but she's sitting there by the firefight, the fire,

[Speaker 1]
Oh shit. I think Hemlock will sit there, but he will not go away.

[Speaker 4]
For a little bit. Eventually. You see her stand up?

[Speaker 2]
And the memories that you had of your mother were of a significantly healthier

[Speaker 4]
And.

[Speaker 2]
More. Youthful person. She, you can see her struggle to get out of her.

[Speaker 2]
And as she approaches the fire, she draws and doubts. Eventually, she just climbs up the stairs and you don't see it anymore. Um, he goes back, he goes back.

[Speaker 1]
Just revisit.

[Speaker 2]
Anything else I I dream of? Fathers. Like, maybe you're in some block song? I dream of how Mark's mom.

[Speaker 1]
Is definitely dreaming about. Yeah.

[Speaker 5]
Hey Al, on the way home, you can see unlocked because he's frustrated he is like?

[Speaker 5]
He's so angry. I'm very confused.

[Speaker 1]
Poor guy!

[Speaker 10]
Since the next section I know is going to be a big one, like, you know, a different realm focus on killing the black Sun? How we found a place where norbeldom yet?

[Speaker 4]
I think we should.

[Speaker 1]
Considering like the big chance? Like, as always, one of us.

[Speaker 3]
I know who may take care of adorable gum? I, we can send him to Eastern Edgar with my parents who will happily take care of him as he sacrificed his life to save their son.

[Speaker 1]
That point actually.

[Speaker 6]
So fantastic. Idea finish goes. I think that would work. Um, how do we bring him there? I guess we can hire somebody. Has it been two weeks? Since what? Since he was starting to learn, oh?

[Speaker 2]
I'll say yes. Well, what's two weeks? Should we go also?

[Speaker 10]
He goes.

[Speaker 2]
I do believe I can probably pass that spell. It takes me a day to prepare it and to actually, like, uh, recover from it, but I can probably get him there. Should we do that?

[Speaker 6]
Yeah, I think so. That's a good idea. So, would it

[Speaker 1]
Just be you two going? And I guess so, unless you want to come and see Mom and Dad,

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, of course. Okay. Take another day for us to come back, so hopefully everyone can wait for that.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah, sure, we can try to look into the pocket playing stuff while they're gone. I will go wash my boiler. It's been a while. Help. You guys whisk away.

[Speaker 2]
Uh, we're gonna leave you reuniting with your parents for the next session. Really, I want that to be something that we actually roll. Play fully.

[Speaker 1]
Thank you some stuff about them. When I originate the characters, I'll check it out first.

[Speaker 2]
Take like points of order. We're going through the list. You guys also have a shift of gold, so maybe you want to spend that,

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, I need. I need better armor. I need one 100. I need better armor. I just don't want to do shopping.

[Speaker 5]
Did we do like?

[Speaker 3]
Are shopping on the in the down time.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, you can

[Speaker 2]
Also do that. Yeah, I could also just. I mean, you guys have like a bunch of gold. All of the default items that you can find on, uh, DND you can buy. Can I? Can I borrow um?

[Speaker 5]
Can I borrow a 500 gold from the bank

[Speaker 1]
Cool 100 gold?

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, wait, what do you need to buy? I'm getting a breastplate, which will give me one more AC. Well,

[Speaker 3]
Don't you already a half half point? Well, aren't you maybe getting that we should decide what we're doing for the armor. Whether you're getting that armor or bitey's game,

[Speaker 2]
Um,

[Speaker 5]
You haven't added the armor yet, I think no, because I'm waiting for either of you to decide on whether I see the armor.

[Speaker 3]
Different time. So easy,

[Speaker 4]
Bruh. I'll buy him. I'll buy him a halfway. I think you should get the better armor and we get mighty. They all right, what armor is it against? Oh, because I think it was better armor and we didn't get pushed and stuff. No, where was it?

[Speaker 4]
So, I don't remember where it is.

[Speaker 2]
Resistant

[Speaker 3]
To piercing and slashing down. That's pretty

[Speaker 5]
Fucking good. Yeah, that's

[Speaker 3]
Like what I get for rage basically.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah,

[Speaker 4]
You have a disadvantage of dextailing.

[Speaker 5]
When was the last time I did an ex-saving throw? I don't remember, quite often, we do them.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, I don't need that shit. It's only like Fireball. This is my father.

[Speaker 5]
Uh, this is, yep, I'll wait.

[Speaker 2]
This is Colby. Hi,

[Speaker 5]
This is Robert. Did you end up catching any fish? No, just come Driftwood.

[Speaker 10]
Where did you go fishing? Well, the same spot, Tim, but, uh, this time. They're like tons of people. And. And not the thing is jumping.

[Speaker 5]
Next time. What kind of fish were you trying to catch some? I mean, I I was reading somewhere that it was like, like, a really good year, first time in Canada, right? It was like one of the biggest time it runs. It is, yes.

[Speaker 5]
I was making fun of you.

[Speaker 5]
Is? This is like, it's okay, it's just gambling. You just have to go again. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, exactly. Now, you really have to catch it. Yeah. Next time for sure.

[Speaker 5]
You guys finish the game, or I think we're almost. Yeah, it's like another 10 minutes or something.

[Speaker 2]
Hood. I

[Speaker 1]
Agree, we don't do the the shopping in the downtime. Like, yeah,

[Speaker 2]
We absolutely can do that,

[Speaker 5]
Especially for stuff. That's just like potions, and like that kind of stuff, I'm sorry. It's like, like two more minutes, like one more minute, but uh.

[Speaker 1]
Just like taking our membership. Yeah,

[Speaker 5]
I just when I ask that, is there any way that some human armor can apply to baby because that was, like, the idea with that one, just because there's like only a good thing you can buy for, like X,

[Speaker 2]
Is probably

[Speaker 1]
Hanging away. But it is, yeah.

[Speaker 2]
About even the most important or the second most important attacks.

[Speaker 5]
How does its saving for work, like, like when somebody cast Fireball? It's like, you take full damage, or do you take half? Oh my, gosh, yeah, wait, yeah, wait, I'm like.

[Speaker 2]
That was a lot more important in

[Speaker 1]
The wildlands, right? Because there was a lot of big area of, like things, I don't think we'll be running into that a lot right and resistance against flashing and bludgeoning is really good. Probably, I mean, across.
