# Description


# Entrance

It is said that a demon has been sealed in the dungeon near the small village of Silverpass, a village on a trading route in between larger towns of different kingdoms. Right at the border in between two kingdoms, it welcomes peoples of both, and is for most a stop on the way, for others it is where they sell the wool, wood, and ore they sourced from nearby. The route there is said to be rife with danger, from bandits to risky weather. Most travel in bands, with either a hired hand amongst them or at least a person wielding a weapon, and a local guiding them through the terrain and weather. Nearby Silverpass, an ancient temple lays, left alone by superstition. Rumors say it has been claiming more and more victims recently...
