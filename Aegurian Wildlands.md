The Aegurian Wildlands are a region south of the continent of [[Aegur]], famous for being almost entirely devoid of humanoids and being extraordinarily hostile to them. The island inhabits a very high concentration of monsters and beasts. 

# History 
The island has three small humanoid settlements that have been around for about 200 years or so, [[North Point]], [[Cerulean Rise]], and [[Last Respite]]. But the rest of the island is uninhabited and does not feature history from the Planewalker's age. The island has marks of a civilization long past however. 

## Traces of times long past
The island features seven known ruins, each with their individual characteristics and aesthetics. Adventurers and hunters visit these ruins for varying reasons, trying to find treasure or to uncover history long forgotten. 

# Hunting
The island is famous for being the most ecologically rich and dangerous place on [[Vostera]]. As such, a slew of brave hunters come to the island every year to attempt to slay the most dangerous beasts in existence. All three settlements hosts the hunters that have just arrived, as well as farm some of the more minor creatures of the area. They also feature teleportation circles that cost 50 gold per person to transport from Tarisma, Padena, and Nagan, or 10 gold each if you are part of a hunter's guild. 


## Zones
The Aegurian Wildlands are split into four different hunting zones. 

### Blue 
Zone blue, or zone zero is the zone where all of the settlements and about a quarter of the island is. It mostly covers the north coast of the island, and is populated with the easiest creatures to deal with. Most parties that adventure in this zone come back with no casualties.
