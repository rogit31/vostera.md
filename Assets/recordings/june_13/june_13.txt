[Speaker 1]
So, the more you guys dwell on this, the more it's gonna get.

[Speaker 2]
And, and there's no risk because

[Speaker 3]
They have just great DNA, and they just. There's no chance of an overlapping bad dream to cause heat,

[Speaker 1]
Or there's enough genetic mutations even in between, and uh inside. And so, yeah, yeah.

[Speaker 2]
Have Down syndrome.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, so guys,

[Speaker 1]
Right? But let's not talk about it.

[Speaker 2]
Okay,

[Speaker 1]
You're gonna head. Count it however you want. Um, however. Little dragons are they big? Are they big are the dragons that he's showing as big? Are their baby ones ranging? Uh, you can see them. There is a range of them. I mean, you see, uh, like in the field of grass ahead of you, that there are dozens, maybe even hundreds of dragon eggs,

[Speaker 2]
Um?

[Speaker 1]
A lot of dragons to be born. There are smaller dragons that are kind of like, now starting to like, fly around, and like, creep around you. A bunch of different colors. There's black, red, green, some metallic dragons as well, um. So, it seems like there's like a very, you know, a wide variety of kind of dragons here. And he kind of like. Points to all of them and goes. Obviously. As you can see, most of them aren't quite young. But eventually this will be forced to be reckoned with. And I doubt that even vespero would be able to fend off this many of these flying tanks.

[Speaker 2]
So he he's breeding. These dragons as a war weapon.

[Speaker 1]
It's like a potency

[Speaker 4]
Plan,

[Speaker 1]
Like what? What happens if everything turns out fine? What are you going to do with these 100 dragons.

[Speaker 2]
You have the power dragons are child soldiers, is what,

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, okay, so you're not there. But if you wish to participate, you can, um. I mean, for the most part, these dragons are perfectly happy to just stay around here. The Agorian wildlands are a perfect environment for them. Thanks for them to hunt and the vast majority of them don't actually eat meat in that way, right? Um,

[Speaker 2]
They

[Speaker 1]
Just feed off of the ether of the land. Even if there's a lot of them,

[Speaker 2]
And this is maybe just me doubting, you know? Like when you have this much power, the person who is responsible for? You know, deserves further examination. I have no idea. What you're after? Now what? What's

[Speaker 1]
The only? Plan that I intended to use all of these for, um. Is, if there comes a point where? There

[Speaker 3]
Is

[Speaker 1]
No such thing as Liberties, and if the academy takes over particularly Edgar, because that's where I've held my. Um, my own land in my own home at this point. Again, it will take quite some time before this plant to be ready. But if it does come to it, and also it's? Of Defense.

[Speaker 3]
This is,

[Speaker 1]
I mean, all of this will certainly protect a book better than I can, right?

[Speaker 2]
Okay. You guys are okay with this, like, how long

[Speaker 5]
Approximately will it take for these guys to be useful in the plan you're imagining

[Speaker 1]
As a defense mechanism? It is already useful, um. Have high hopes that the Sparrow would not wander this far into the egoon wildlands.

[Speaker 1]
I think it's not herself. I just think she values her own life enough to not do that. As an attack, uh, plan. It will certainly take. A long time. In Belmont here. 600, 700 years old.

[Speaker 3]
Um,

[Speaker 1]
And I mean, most of these are have been born in the last hundred or so years.

[Speaker 3]
So?

[Speaker 1]
Probably another 200. Yes, so. I know it's. Out of the reach of the Mortal scale. Um, for the most of you, but um, I just wanted to show you the contingency plan. And. Well, this is what I'm using to protect the book. I see, kind of like Pats on the sack next time. We know, like how a regular Dragon Stacks up to a beholder. Um, yes. It really depends on the dragon, uh, like some of the younger dragons that you see here. 50, 50, uh, and ancient red dragons, like Bearman, not even close. Okay,

[Speaker 2]
What

[Speaker 1]
A beholder. Pause that was in the portal that was really scary.

[Speaker 4]
You wanted to show this to us. Why?

[Speaker 1]
Well, um. It was mostly for you to know, just in case. I think that. You. Most of you have good intentions and want to fend off the spirits as much as I want. Um. And I wanted to reassure you that even if. Um, your plant controls are other people in the world doing something about it, um. And also. Because I do want to keep the book and I was fearing after earlier's encounter that you would want to wrestle the book out of my heads. Um, I'm showing you that I have the ways to defend myself.

[Speaker 2]
Can we? Sorry, I mustn't hit my head, um. Can you remind me why we're here? Like, why we need the book again?

[Speaker 4]
Where we then need a bug.

[Speaker 2]
We

[Speaker 4]
Need the Tome we needed to prevent the Sparrow from getting hit. Oh, I

[Speaker 2]
See. Uh, yeah, we, we definitely don't have a dragon army. Yet.

[Speaker 1]
Anyways, um, I'm going to spend a lot more time deeper into the wildlands. Now, around here.

[Speaker 2]
Do we reach you

[Speaker 1]
Magical means? Mostly, if you have means of communication, I believe you do. That would be it. I'll bring you back, um? I mean, let me know if you have any questions I do. Want to help you and I do wish you luck. I get some spare up. Wanted to? Inform you? I. Do not have all the answers that you have been looking for as far as. The spare I really wants and. Um, Zeke might. Look like a want, um?

[Speaker 1]
I think you, uh, you find yourselves in a position where you have. These large political ideologies that are clashing against each other and? Um. Maybe giving you more answers? Something that would be good. That's agreeable, though. Yeah,

[Speaker 4]
We like answers.

[Speaker 1]
There are a few places I think where we, you could probably learn more than just through me. I believe you've already visited one of them Titanfall. Um. That's one place where you can get information from and probably discover a bunch more information. Also, possibly the place where I was raised, um.

[Speaker 1]
Um, back in the Asia Valley. If you can find specifically where that place where I grew up was, which should look very similar to. I believe you mentioned some kind of, uh, extra dimensional space where you

[Speaker 3]
Were wyvern, Peak island,

[Speaker 2]
Or whatever it's called.

[Speaker 1]
That was like a replica old home, like that kind of thing, right? If you can find the house that looks like that, which is now, you know, run down. Um, probably looks quite different, but if you can find that place specifically, it's still in the Asurion Valley somewhere and is protected.

[Speaker 4]
Um.

[Speaker 1]
It's got it off, but it's not. Doesn't have any of the books anymore or anything like that, but it can probably find some Clues there. That's what actually went down into. My mother was. Um, those are two places that I would think of and obviously the books. If you can find more of them, that would always be good. Um, but as far as fighting answers would go, that's the place that I'm thinking of. Hmm, I guess this. Is it then?

[Speaker 2]
Oh, we don't want the. Like, are we just gonna be done with this island then?

[Speaker 1]
Okay, so. Have to go back. And yeah,

[Speaker 2]
We do. Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
Um, Uno. What was the name of the spell that you used to put yourself into Phineas's body and like transfer? I didn't give it a name yet.

[Speaker 4]
Um,

[Speaker 1]
I didn't really. The semantics of it didn't matter to me specifically, but. What do you think it should be named something like, Consciousness, transfer, maybe? Sure, I'm more interested virus

[Speaker 2]
Spell.

[Speaker 1]
I'm more interested in the means of which you came up with it. Like, do you think anyone else could come up with this spell? Yes, I mean it. It is a very specific spell to be fair. Um, I don't think that that many people.

[Speaker 2]
Who

[Speaker 1]
Are old enough to be able to encounter some spell. And especially research the spell for this long without being found out by the academy. But I have no doubt in my mind that there are probably other people who have managed to find. Um, similar solutions to my problem, uh, particularly in the other continents, not in the Asia Empire. And have you been able to like pick up any of like the restrictions because you know you mentioned that the body like the body blood on the phone was dead. I'm just trying to ask if, like, are there limitations of this spell, like, does it last for so long, but isn't it?

[Speaker 1]
Once you're in someone's body, and he kind of like points to his newly. Freshly plucked. Body, uh, he goes. I mean, once you're in the body and your mind is in it. That's it. I mean, does your mind is your own? And there's really nothing to do. Um, but the constraint is that the body must be fresh. The body starts decaying at a very quick pace, and the longer it decays well, the faster you will die in your new body. And if you? Aren't capable of extracting your own Consciousness again, then well. That's just it.

[Speaker 1]
Um. Very well.

[Speaker 2]
Probably, like, yeah,

[Speaker 1]
Wings have, like, a little. Yeah, yeah, you. You have little animated, you know? Um, he goes, I'll um, I'll have bearman fly you back. Is there anything else that I can help you with?

[Speaker 2]
God luck anything!

[Speaker 4]
I think this is it.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah,

[Speaker 6]
Very well.

[Speaker 2]
No more gear,

[Speaker 1]
Actually. Could you write down all the names of your siblings like write them down? Even if they're dead.

[Speaker 6]
Sure, uh, he starts like writing it down in a page of like his book.

[Speaker 1]
And then rips it out. Um, can you passes your paper with a bunch of names on bed, uh, I don't have like a record of 30 days?

[Speaker 1]
You recognize. A obviously recognize, um, you know, Vespera? Zeke. You also recognize Nola ashir. Who is the first, uh, Empress of? The issue Empire? She's

[Speaker 7]
The

[Speaker 6]
Founder of the Yoshi Empire, and she's

[Speaker 1]
Seen in like a lot of like historical texts and documents. Um, she's also allowed as being like the first. Um, spellcaster, besides the plane Walker. And you see a bunch of other names. A lot of them have, uh, there's a few of them. Sorry, that have like the name of Shear in them, um. Like three or four. Um, a few other have, uh, very like Dwarven sounding names. Some of them have Elven sounding names. They seem like there's really little mix here. Does

[Speaker 4]
Anything stand out in particular

[Speaker 1]
Besides like those names that you already knew? Not really. Um, yeah, is

[Speaker 2]
There anyone named Bore on those? There's a long lineage.

[Speaker 1]
You know what roll these funny? Actually, you roll a 20, they'll be aboard on the list. I

[Speaker 2]
Never,

[Speaker 4]
Never,

[Speaker 2]
Uh?

[Speaker 1]
Um. Berman flags you back to his old Abode um, and to rejoin with the rest of your party. Berman kind of lets you like leap off of his back. He gives you a nod, and then he flies away. Right before you, departuno kind of just gives you like a heartfelt encouragement. You go! You know, what's that? You guys all rejoin, uh, you guys have, uh, you know, night, uh, ahead of you to? Do whatever you wish. I did mention last time we played that as far as the trip back goes, uh, you guys have the option of teleporting directly to.

[Speaker 1]
Uh, one of the the sanctuaries in the Edgar in the wildlands, uh, through your teleportation spell. However, also, give you the option to hunt down any of the monsters that you wished from the table, Rolla D4. See how many of them you can get and then based off of how many you slay. You would also get the equivalent amount of loot. Or you do not get to long rest at any points that is the one addendum that I added. Because I think it's gonna be more fun this way, but also

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, like, short grass. Anyways, yes, please throw my throw it.

[Speaker 1]
I will put it on the TV, uh, it is also pinned in the Discord, I believe. Yeah, yeah.

[Speaker 4]
How's

[Speaker 2]
The beer? Some, um, some rap bought it for me.

[Speaker 4]
Of the beer.

[Speaker 3]
It's, it's not very weird. It is right,

[Speaker 1]
It's a really, really, really dark trout. Yeah,

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, it's ten and a half percent.

[Speaker 1]
Wow! That would get me fucked up.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, is Godless, like? I don't know what it is, but I can taste something really familiar.

[Speaker 1]
It's like,

[Speaker 2]
Coffee. Yeah, it's coffee.

[Speaker 1]
It's like coffee, the toffee notes, hm. So this is

[Speaker 2]
That sounds really good.

[Speaker 1]
This is kind of the top of the top of, uh, the monsters as far as it goes. You already slayed a bezel G's, uh, and you got the charged Mall from it. Yeah, wait,

[Speaker 2]
Who

[Speaker 1]
Got there? Who got this, we we

[Speaker 2]
Haven't gone back. Yeah, so we have don't have the loot yet. Yes, we have good materials to make.

[Speaker 1]
That's correct.

[Speaker 2]
The cocaine that you and,

[Speaker 1]
And we decided, one of us is going to take it, right? Yeah. So, should we? I mean, I don't know what our goals are. Now, there's like time in the fall. There's golden birthplace. There's just straight beeline to kill Zeke. If we can, there's kill respirus soon as possible. I don't think we're gonna get to kill Vespara right now. See how the guns were because we also have eighth of us that, like, for ether of us, that reduce a bunch of stuff if you wear them. Where do we get those from, uh? We took them from the research facility, and we, it was 10 in our bag of Holden! Wow! So if we want to have an army wheel so we can't do that?

[Speaker 2]
I'm sorry, long story is two-handed, right?

[Speaker 1]
I believe it's, isn't it versatile? Yeah.

[Speaker 4]
Monday 6 101 details to enter.

[Speaker 1]
Um, I'm still wondering. Okay, there I was on in the easy area. Yeah, there was one that was a bonus to stealth as well. You guys can tell me if you want me to scroll up or down.

[Speaker 2]
Can we can? We can I get this?

[Speaker 1]
Yep, like, like, is it just me? Or is this insane? This 15 plus

[Speaker 2]
X,

[Speaker 1]
Oh! Another thing to note is like, if you want the best, oh yeah, it has the resistance. You can't wear them at the same time as armor, they are. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, like, yeah,

[Speaker 2]
It's leather armor, and it gives you resistance to like fire ice, uh, lightning Thunder?

[Speaker 1]
Look, you're the best. Yeah.

[Speaker 2]
We bought like 20 of them. Yeah, you can't get plenty of them. You could also just get filthy Ridge by selling them.

[Speaker 1]
That makes me like it.

[Speaker 2]
We could forget about Vespara and just start a business right now.

[Speaker 1]
Just become weapons dealers. I was,

[Speaker 2]
Yeah,

[Speaker 1]
I was that I was like, we used to recruit a little Grassroots of Alicia. And, you know, okay, this is becoming very high level game plan. At this point,

[Speaker 3]
You're not doing fighting anymore. We're just directing.

[Speaker 1]
He's becoming RTS at this point. Are you friends? Does lavender have, oh yeah, oh

[Speaker 8]
My God. Like RTS, like

[Speaker 2]
People practices, go back to the guy that that Boris is with.

[Speaker 1]
Right, right, right? I completely forgot his name. What was his name? My heart. Was it Tusk or something? I

[Speaker 2]
Think his car, okay,

[Speaker 1]
It's somewhere in my nose.

[Speaker 3]
We should go get Boris and have boars toward the party. Would

[Speaker 1]
You guys like me to scroll up? Yes, yes. Well, are we good? This is for sure.

[Speaker 1]
This is pretty fucking sick.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, the long sword I was looking at that.

[Speaker 1]
These two are really good, but oh,

[Speaker 3]
This one, isn't this one really good to the the fangirl boots super heavy at Warhammer.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, yeah, oh yeah,

[Speaker 2]
I want that one. Wait, the long sword is insane. That's what I'm saying. The long sword is actually, it's Suzanne. No, wait. The the bamboo Warhammer is actually insane.

[Speaker 2]
Damage. The crates are 19 or 20, and you do an additional boof around it. Yeah, that's true, and I will get it, so it'll be 18, 19, or 20 as a credit, and also

[Speaker 1]
You get extra speed when you you get to boot. You get a speed boost, right? Yeah, I,

[Speaker 2]
I have 40 speeds, so it's not a big deal, then I'd be normal speed. All right,

[Speaker 1]
Let's get this for you.

[Speaker 2]
I want that one, yeah? Or

[Speaker 1]
Get this for me with your Reckless attack too.

[Speaker 1]
Would be useful for me just because I'm more squishy. So, how was the what's what are you offering us to get these again?

[Speaker 4]
I'm

[Speaker 1]
Sorry.

[Speaker 3]
Like, what can we do it together?

[Speaker 1]
We're gonna fight these guys. Oh yeah, bite them at, like, hard mode, yeah? But okay, what's the? What's the detail? So right now, I'm letting you guys, uh, before I was like a random check to see if you like it was. But now, I'm telling you. You can specifically hunt these monsters. Now, you have the time for it. So you can choose who you want to battle. Uh, the only thing is once you like pick any of these. One of you will roll a D4, and that's a number of enemies. You're gonna get a member of these fuckers. Yes, that's correct. I mean, that's not that bad. Okay, so after we did things when we have to roll a G4 for each one to determine which one of these are? I'll let you guys pick. Yeah, okay, yeah, that's not. Okay, let's go. Is

[Speaker 2]
There an all pick one thing like we can look at the other one. Can we all pick one thing I just voluntarily fight for it once?

[Speaker 2]
I don't know if we can take

[Speaker 1]
Four of them. We can.

[Speaker 3]
It would preparation we're hunting them, right? We can prepare. I'll charge up some guns.

[Speaker 2]
Oh yeah,

[Speaker 4]
The guns.

[Speaker 1]
Can we see the other list please?

[Speaker 2]
Yes, yes. Yes, yes, of

[Speaker 1]
Course. And but lower level. Yeah, these are the monkeys by the way.

[Speaker 1]
It only made drink acid.

[Speaker 3]
Correct?

[Speaker 2]
I have a question, yes, how cheap do we want to get? Now what? How cheap do we want to guess because you see the last item over there?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah.

[Speaker 2]
Theoretically, if we got a bunch of these, can't we just like stun lock the sparrow if all of them just throw bombs at her constantly. She won't be able to move, right? She'll just be grappled every single turn. Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
You're right, you

[Speaker 2]
Are. She

[Speaker 1]
Still has to make a saving throw.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, but if, like, one, two, or three, four, five of us throw one every single turn. Yeah, that's the thing that she's alone as well, huh? That just to make you a little? Well, yeah, we're gonna

[Speaker 1]
Have to get her. Or are we gonna be Army? And then we get her along. Okay, I'll put that on the list.

[Speaker 2]
I'm okay for anything

[Speaker 3]
Any any of these bowls that you like?

[Speaker 4]
No, I think I'm probably just gonna be walking from now on.

[Speaker 1]
A big artist, and then I started blasting. Okay,

[Speaker 2]
No blasting again. Those wishing her staff will be insane for you though. So,

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, I, I do kind of want the whiskers down.

[Speaker 4]
And there's

[Speaker 1]
Also for

[Speaker 2]
You. What would be crazy is?

[Speaker 4]
Where is?

[Speaker 2]
The other one that every time you deal fire damage, you get a 1d8 that's on the other one. The glavine is, or whatever,

[Speaker 4]
Well, yeah, one

[Speaker 1]
Below. You

[Speaker 4]
Could have poison to your your arrows, and that could be good.

[Speaker 2]
Is that armor, though, cuz I would have

[Speaker 3]
The

[Speaker 1]
Bracers are not. Oh

[Speaker 2]
Okay, yeah, so if you, if you shoot a scorching Ray, every single scorching gray you should deal with an additional 1d8

[Speaker 1]
Oh, holy shit.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, shit, okay. I think I like that one more than the staff, cuz I don't really use, um.

[Speaker 2]
Pretty cool almost there. Actually, yeah. Cool down. Like, Chris all the time now.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah. I'm excited for your, uh,

[Speaker 2]
Like the big one. Let's, let's go and order priority. Let's go without that much time. Let's go down here. Let's start. Let's start with the with the the either the Warhammer or the long sword. One of the things we already have we have the

[Speaker 1]
You have to charge them all, and we have

[Speaker 2]
The blow gun from the bubble guy, right? Yeah,

[Speaker 1]
Chargeball,

[Speaker 2]
And into the horn. Yeah, single basil geese heart pendant all right.

[Speaker 1]
Are you using no?

[Speaker 1]
Get it,

[Speaker 2]
But Robin can do the, uh? The deaf word thing that you can't die the first time happens. Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
You're welcome, cozy yourself.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, I feel like,

[Speaker 1]
If

[Speaker 2]
You go, right, yeah, so that's

[Speaker 1]
Also the logic that you guys use last time.

[Speaker 2]
Have their own success. Oh, I'm okay with anything. Okay, fine. The part is these two. Yeah,

[Speaker 1]
I can also recast that I,

[Speaker 3]
I don't know what to let's you want to go for the Warhammer first.

[Speaker 1]
Um, I want the cape from the mountain about jokes, the monobos Cape. Yeah, those are pretty cool.

[Speaker 2]
You just don't get crit.

[Speaker 3]
Is

[Speaker 1]
That? Yeah.

[Speaker 2]
Fighting all of the ones in the artist Zone every single time.

[Speaker 1]
And then there's, uh, I mean, there's much more u. These are definitely not as strong, but also potentially useful. Nah!

[Speaker 3]
I don't see any good ones. This one is

[Speaker 1]
The same one as one. This one's not bad, but you're about to get a better one than this.

[Speaker 9]
Yeah, right. Okay, let's all right.

[Speaker 1]
All I want is better armor. After all this, I want better armor

[Speaker 3]
Warhammer. Let's do the Warhammer.

[Speaker 1]
Let's do the Warhammer. First, yeah, let's roll up. You're the one getting it, so you're all like, if if you roll four of them, then before we're all fully. We're all long rested and everything, right? Yes, yeah.

[Speaker 1]
And, uh.

[Speaker 2]
We should. We should.

[Speaker 3]
I'm gonna make.

[Speaker 4]
New thing in my notes.

[Speaker 2]
So, how? How many should I do?

[Speaker 3]
How much charges should I do?

[Speaker 4]
One of them is already charged, right? But what level are we

[Speaker 2]
That one?

[Speaker 3]
That one is now a fifth level spells lock, though, because we long rested one fifth.

[Speaker 2]
I have one as a fourth. You can probably have mine fourth level one. Okay, because I'm probably not gonna use it, come here. Hello,

[Speaker 1]
Or

[Speaker 3]
I've I'll I charge another, so you have a six as well. Now, I charge six. Amazing, and then I'll do. Of course, I'll help you. I'll do another four, okay, girl.

[Speaker 2]
So that's, that's all the.

[Speaker 3]
Garages, some trees, whatever you have. Two, four, one, five, one, six.

[Speaker 2]
We're drawing the map for the battle. Oh, all right, I'm Gonna Roll How Me, Bambaro, we have to fight

[Speaker 1]
Exactly. Listen. Do

[Speaker 2]
You want a gun. I kind of, uh,

[Speaker 1]
I'm I'm kind of male. I don't know if I need a gun.

[Speaker 2]
Three,

[Speaker 1]
Three, three, you, you guys can just like, kill one, and run away. Also, that was okay.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah,

[Speaker 1]
Okay,

[Speaker 2]
One was pretty hard.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, yeah, but you guys are now two levels up

[Speaker 4]
Two levels, um, yeah. And we got a lot of Hoots, and we got a lot of loot. Lavender is here too as well. It's got this.

[Speaker 1]
You keep like going crazy? Yeah,

[Speaker 2]
Andre. Some rocks, yeah,

[Speaker 1]
Draw some stuff.

[Speaker 2]
Are they in white?

[Speaker 1]
Yes, yeah. And you can add the elevation next to it.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, I just had them sparsely, great. I'm gonna recruit you guys every single time now, actually. It's a lot more easier.

[Speaker 1]
Just make

[Speaker 4]
It a Delta.

[Speaker 4]
How heavy am? Oh, these are so light,

[Speaker 1]
Only 250, yeah.

[Speaker 4]
The

[Speaker 1]
Description is motivated to make coin by any means possible. Oh yeah, was that the was that the original intent was that magazine money hungry? Part.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, now she's an environmentalist.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, originally, when we made your character, you were like? The

[Speaker 3]
Underbelly, yeah, and I

[Speaker 1]
Really like that. I, that the idea of that, but just didn't fit into the story very well, and like it didn't align with, like, what we were doing, whatever. Like, whenever I was, like, oh, maybe I should have able to steal stuff. It was like, no, we're like doing something else right now. So, yeah, sorry. It's okay, I don't like derailing stuff. So it was fun, cuz I think they have some fun new, like they had where you added some stuff that we didn't have before. Like, I got to do acolyte with this kind of fun. Yeah, we switched her genres.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah. Yeah, we like to experiment here. Okay, that looks pretty good to me.

[Speaker 10]
Okay,

[Speaker 1]
So we're gonna start combat. Let me get here exactly.

[Speaker 4]
I'll say these are.

[Speaker 1]
Say these three are yay! Oh, oh yeah,

[Speaker 2]
Wait, no, that door was on. Shirley,

[Speaker 1]
No doorbellum is either the gnome or if he ever wants to use the other, like sad, looking old days. No, who

[Speaker 2]
Is that warlord? No, you know what I like that, isn't this normal,

[Speaker 3]
Though, is

[Speaker 1]
He supposed to be a wizard?

[Speaker 2]
I forgot it.

[Speaker 1]
It does look like I do like that, but it's not like a warlock.

[Speaker 2]
I think it's the last section.

[Speaker 1]
There's a bunch more minions if you want them.

[Speaker 2]
No, no, I'll take this. I guess it's not this, right? I

[Speaker 3]
Can't believe, no, I don't think you want? Yeah, you get a cap like a, a big big witch's hat. I mean

[Speaker 1]
Who the fuck is this Dumbledore? It's a troll, but we're using it as a place

[Speaker 2]
Someone I used to use before

[Speaker 1]
Robin Hawk. Okay, so I'm gonna need all of you guys, uh, I assume you're trying to stealth up on these guys? Just, yeah, an upper hand.

[Speaker 2]
Or anything first?

[Speaker 1]
Uh, who wants that forward? You guys need to? Uh, be a 15,

[Speaker 2]
39,

[Speaker 1]
Yeah. So, one success two successes. Fail fail!

[Speaker 2]
I'm doing the evil thing.

[Speaker 1]
It hinges on you. It's a fail. Okay, uh, for the first time, actually in a very long time, you guys are not going to get around to surprise onto here.

[Speaker 2]
Ooh,

[Speaker 1]
Okay, uh, position yourselves on the map. I'll say you definitely need to get a little bit of space, and so this time. Going to be rolling in with you? Uh, but you can guys, you can still position yourselves wherever you want on the map. Okay, and let's get started

[Speaker 2]
Me. You can actually take it off your sheet. Or no, I did not. Where are you positioning yourself, me? And yeah, I want to wear the vet anyways.

[Speaker 1]
You're gonna wear the best,

[Speaker 3]

[Speaker 2]
He's still disadvantaged with anyone that isn't me. His speed is zero. Andy can hit me,

[Speaker 1]
So you guys are, so it's a very nice act here. His pin is zero, however, he's going to trample the ground, and I'm going to may, I'm going to need. A 30 foot radius, which is 5, 10, 15. Uh, 20, 25, 30. Yeah, so everyone except the person was there. Uh, make a. Uh, DC, strength saving threat.

I, I just know how to keep the characters are. I mean.

[Speaker 1]
He does have another attack. Let's go.

[Speaker 2]
Because this is one thing that he has inwardly. I have. I was a Menace on camera.

[Speaker 1]
Oh yeah, all right.

[Speaker 4]
It's gonna attack.

[Speaker 1]
Look at that hits. Yep. And then it does.

[Speaker 3]
Okay,

[Speaker 1]
Let me know when you figure that out. Okay, uh, May your turn, um, how many, like, uh, when you imbue the gun with the smell. How long does it take? Is it like an action under itself? Uh, you can charge it and shoot it as an action. Arm. For my action, though, I'm actually going to pass old monster. Okay, oh, got it. Adidas needs of wisdom 17.

[Speaker 1]
Okay. Uh, that should be.

[Speaker 2]
Poison nine levels at three. It fails, however, because

[Speaker 1]
These are legendary monsters. They have legendary resistances it uses, uh, the boulder that it just like un rooted from the ground to just like throw it in your direction as you're casting the spell. So? You understand that if it doesn't have something like in between his tusks, they can't do this. Yeah, uh, but is going to use it just for the effect of like being able to resist that smell. Okay, okay, because that's all over again, uh, until the rest of the day. So, I'm going to do my movement. I'm gonna go to the tree. Yep, fight. He's gonna use his movement. Go here and my bonus action Spidey is going to use. Did you figure it out? He takes toll acidic. Something, yeah. So let's see.

[Speaker 1]
One hit 21 hits. Okay, so mighty will do 14 points of damage. Okay, great. What kind of damage? Oh, uh, I'm assuming acid acid? They're tripping balls. Uh, what was the number I said for the total like 17 and 14.

[Speaker 1]
So minus? Eight of that is acid. Okay, it ignores the acid damage. Okay, it's immune test damage number 14, minus native. 14, minus eight. That is six, yes. We can do that.

[Speaker 2]
I don't think all together we've got so much damage as you did on your turn.

[Speaker 9]
Yeah, exactly, uh, no, actually, you're you. You did more Dad,

[Speaker 2]
Really? Yep.

[Speaker 1]
Uh, okay, that is, uh, Bambaro, number three. Tres I just asked to. I just gotta make its way. 5, 10, that's half now, so it's. Uh, 40, no. 30.

How do you rolling for three years? Uh, yeah, the Baymeier that's like in front of you is looking fucked up. That's enough Dad. Is fucked up. Uh, that is what I will say. That's the end of your turn.

[Speaker 2]
Yep,

[Speaker 1]
Okay, uh, remember that Hero's gonna use its legendary action, uh, and is going to trample you. It should also be hitting 5, 10, 15, 20, that one five. This one doesn't use it's only interaction yet. They can use the legendary actions at the end of anyone else's turn. Oh, okay.

[Speaker 2]
Um, is this being difficult train? Is that going to affect anything?

That's on it. Okay, that helps.

[Speaker 9]
Sorry, Tony damage.

[Speaker 1]
Here we go. Three times ago,

[Speaker 2]
We've done like 50 damages even close. He's really close.

[Speaker 3]
Can we kill four of these?

[Speaker 1]
One, two, three, only three. Uh, this guy is gonna use his legendary action, uh, and he is going to use his movement to trample in the way. If users are going to go in a straight line straight towards you,

[Speaker 2]
Okay, as he leaves fly? Disadvantage on everybody is that matter, because,

[Speaker 1]
Uh, no, no, no, it's like, as he leaves my. He doesn't provoke opportunity effects.

[Speaker 2]
My essentially means I hit them, even if they don't develop opportunity attacks.

[Speaker 1]
Justin, I don't think you're rolling with your weapon correctly. Okay, how's that you need to be trolling an additional 1d10?

[Speaker 9]
Oh my God, you're totally right. Okay, um, that's. I knew your numbers were low

[Speaker 1]
For some reason.

[Speaker 2]
Where is Speaks, you know,

[Speaker 1]
No, uh, while you're checking that though? Uh, it's gonna go. So, this is lavender, right? Yes, okay. And then he's going to just smash in the rock beneath you. And as he does so, you feel like a rock beneath you start to crumble. Then you get an attack of opportunity, so we're checking that right now. But um, it's a legendary action that doesn't promote, uh, attack of opportunities, uh. Luck. Can you fall to the ground? Uh, you'll have to make a deck. Safe

[Speaker 2]
Helicopter attacks me, even if they take to disengage action before leaving your reach.

[Speaker 1]
So, it's not the scheduled. I've missed out on a whole

[Speaker 9]
1d10 per attack wrong. Now

[Speaker 1]
You know. Hey, that's your problem on the

[Speaker 2]
Chris.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, so that's yeah. Lavender and Hemlock, please make a dexterity settings there.

[Speaker 2]
18,

[Speaker 1]
13, that's a fail.

[Speaker 2]
Yep,

[Speaker 4]
Yep. Help, great. Um, I'm fully free, really fine.

[Speaker 1]
That's. Is it three? Oh yeah, no, oh, 40, 10, okay?

[Speaker 1]
Uh, 12, 19. Uh, 25 points of blood sugar damage to you and lavender. Okay, let's take that.

[Speaker 2]
Now, you guys, oh, never mind. Yeah, this is the guy that they both take half,

[Speaker 1]
So you take

[Speaker 2]
Another half.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, yeah, there's no way.

[Speaker 1]
So, that's the banberries to legendary action. That was kite's turn. So now, it's still a real Stern. Is that correct?

[Speaker 1]
This guy is looking really fucked up. The other two are basically. Yeah, I actually did not count at all. I've been struggling lavender's gonna go for him. Yeah, go for it. Term, all right. I wrote the numbers down to

[Speaker 2]
Make this easier.

[Speaker 1]
I'll tell you right now. He has to do 10 points of damage to kill him while he misses both attacks. Okay?

[Speaker 2]
Poor guy.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, yeah, this is completely. Okay, let's get started. Then, he turns around. Nice, nice, nice shame. That's gonna be Ben Baro number three's turn, and he's also going to trample or a legendary action. Excuse me. Sillreal lavender. I'm going to ask. Baby as well. Uh, and. Uh, who's this person here? I forgot. Me. So well. Okay, so all four over here. Dexter 873, please. Mercy. Oh, let's go 20, 20, not 20,

[Speaker 2]
No.

[Speaker 1]

[Speaker 2]
By it

[Speaker 1]
Over there, aren't you? I'm right here.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, baby.

[Speaker 1]
Eight, okay, okay, okay, 11. 1921. Oh, it wasn't realized 21. 22, 27. Uh, 34, 35 points of budgeting damage to those who failed. And 17 for those who succeeded. So, for those who succeeded 17 points of legendary match, I am

[Speaker 3]
Almost dead. So, is lavender?

[Speaker 1]
And you guys are all not from? Oh, I'm so sorry, so sorry. My fault. Okay, uh, that's members three's legendary action.

[Speaker 2]
Actually, yes, we're trying to reduce your damage by QV6.

[Speaker 3]
Your turn.

[Speaker 9]
I might still be one hit, though I have eight points.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah,

[Speaker 2]
It also means I can't opportunity attack anymore Eastern. Time. I've been trampled. Why am I prone this year?

[Speaker 1]
Uh, I just forgot to. If you succeed, are you still prone? No, if you succeed, you're not brown.

[Speaker 9]
Oh, okay,

[Speaker 1]
How was your health?

[Speaker 2]
And mobile our health. I'll

[Speaker 1]
Unfortunately probably let you pass away before I kill everybody. Oh

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, I have deaf board, too. I'm so fine,

[Speaker 1]
Cuz I'll be able to like bring me back.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, I've not I have masked your wounds.

[Speaker 1]
Sounds good. Okay, four people are injured. Okay, uh, so what she wants

[Speaker 2]
You to die? I know it's kind of cruel. He's kind of fucked up.

[Speaker 2]
Story,

[Speaker 1]
Uh, I'll try to charge the eighth or rifle wizard.

[Speaker 1]
Natural, 20. Oh my God, who are you aiming for?

[Speaker 3]
Holy, oh, shit

[Speaker 1]
The guy that's already almost dead. Sure,

[Speaker 2]
Well,

[Speaker 1]
I mean, he's dead. Now, like, there's no way, it's 16 D6 that you're in, or 8,

[Speaker 2]
16, 66.00.

[Speaker 2]
Oh no, no in for this guy.

[Speaker 1]
Hey Leonard, let her play.

[Speaker 3]
16 days experience?

[Speaker 1]
Yes, please?

[Speaker 3]
Okay, that's 54 damage.

[Speaker 1]
Well, that was easy.

[Speaker 2]
Okay,

[Speaker 1]
That number please,

[Speaker 2]
Right?

[Speaker 3]
There's plus 38 plus 28 plus thirty eight plus eight. So the algorithm 54 plus

[Speaker 2]
12.

[Speaker 1]
77,

[Speaker 2]
Not just now.

[Speaker 1]
54 plus 12 66 yes

[Speaker 2]
66 plus five plus five seventy one point eight okay?

[Speaker 1]
It's because you're charging the rifle is as if you're casting a spell. That's why I asked,

[Speaker 2]
Sorry. No, can she do a normal shot again. You

[Speaker 4]
Could do like a normal shot. You can do like an uncharged 1v8.

[Speaker 2]
No, that was on this guy. That was on this guy.

[Speaker 3]
Oh yeah,

[Speaker 1]
New guy, new guy, new guy,

[Speaker 3]
That one, okay?

[Speaker 1]
Okay, so it's not a spell action, but it's an action that you can't do, like, twice, and you're, like, okay,

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, I'll just

[Speaker 1]
Do a regular old thingy.

[Speaker 2]
Which one are you doing? That's

[Speaker 1]
How I hit so moving on. Uh, baby is going to. He's just gonna do liquify meal, so he's gonna have to move closer. Oh, he's already. Yeah, I can liquefied meals

[Speaker 9]
16 D. What,

[Speaker 3]
Uh,

[Speaker 1]
Fifty six it was.

[Speaker 2]
It was a great. Is it crazy? Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, Orville Chrome. If he doesn't, no, just take me down. Okay, got it. Bemberos threes turn who is right here? Yep, we just took a bunch of damage to the face. Uh, he's very pissed off, uh, he is going to. I think bitey is the closest creature to him, so he's just gonna go for biting. Um, he doesn't have Advantage or anything. It's on the role. That's a natural one. Second attack is a 20, and so that hits. Yeah, okay, uh?

[Speaker 1]
312 three home? Uh, oh my God, this little damage okay, uh? 26, 26, plus three. That's 29 points of legending damage, two by eight. Okay, let's start, don't hold up. Okay, face down

[Speaker 3]
Fighting down. Yeah, but

[Speaker 1]
We can bring him back. He's like a person. Oh

[Speaker 3]
My gosh, he's like a person. Place. He's kind of how much health does a body have Seventeen.

[Speaker 9]
Wow, that's not that far from me.

[Speaker 3]
That's like I, I mean, they're

[Speaker 1]
Not that big.

[Speaker 9]
Your wizard dude hung us up.

[Speaker 2]
I still miss all resistant.

[Speaker 3]
What else is?

[Speaker 2]
Sorry,

[Speaker 3]
24 out of the fireball for this guy.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah,

[Speaker 3]
Oh yeah, roll for damage.

[Speaker 3]
21, 21.

[Speaker 2]
Is that on the three or one, this guy okay, the closer one?

[Speaker 1]
Uh, this guy is starting to get a little bit fucked up. This guy's still on the verge of death, uh, the guys haven't killed him yet. So, yeah, this turn. And he's going to go for. Uh, this person who is kites? Uh, that's a 20 to hit on the first attack, and it's an attack ones. Yeah, uh, both attacks hit the first one. Is,

[Speaker 3]
Have you exploded?

[Speaker 1]
That's 11 plus 11. That's 22 points of legendary damage

[Speaker 2]
Down

[Speaker 4]
To 11.00, and that's. That's so cool.

[Speaker 1]
That's 10, 16, 21, 28 points of lodging damage on the second one.

[Speaker 4]
Uh, that's its turn.

[Speaker 1]
So, that's going to be.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah,

[Speaker 9]
Okay, so getting back up is half your movement.

[Speaker 1]
Am I within attacking range of him? Yes, you are as a 10 10 foot reach.

[Speaker 2]
Can you guys think? Are we gonna take down all three of these or what's the strategy? Um.

[Speaker 9]
Hmm. So I my strategy is, I have. I still haven't used any of my spells.

[Speaker 2]
I

[Speaker 9]
Have banishing Smite, whichever reduces it below 50, it just disappears.

[Speaker 1]
Celro is up, right? Yeah, so I

[Speaker 9]
Can, I can. I can kill this guy.

[Speaker 1]
This is perfectly fine, I think yeah. So, like,

[Speaker 9]
Give him a little bit more damage and I can finish him for sure.

[Speaker 2]
I was thinking, uh, and then, yeah, I can also

[Speaker 1]
Finish this guy. Yeah. Or cutting action. Disengage,

[Speaker 9]
Yeah, finish this guy also. It was just good and

[Speaker 1]
How much movement do I have left 15, 15? Things fight. If he disappears, you still get his stuff. That's fine.

[Speaker 9]
Yeah, because he. He comes back. Eventually, he comes back eventually, but now we're all short arrested by then.

[Speaker 1]
All right. And because he's in his range, I can just do a normal sneak attack, but without Advantage, right? Yes, that's correct. Yeah. On fingers crossed, and I crap.

[Speaker 9]
Oh, you'll have to roll.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah,

[Speaker 1]
And then the guy next to him, this one. Yes, he is that, right? Yeah, and just leave him on the mouth. As you know?

[Speaker 1]
That's terrible. Wrong. Nine damage.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, necrotic

[Speaker 2]
Attacks.

[Speaker 1]
It,

[Speaker 2]
Maybe we should do that the other way? Yeah, you didn't know you were going to quit. Oh. Okay, perfect. Uh, you guys

[Speaker 1]
Slay the first Ben Barrow as it kind of gives out like a little scream and just, uh, crumbles underneath its own weight. Going to be the second member's turn. Uh, so it's this guy. Because everybody who's not you? It's just gonna go for the easiest Target, which is probably either of you two here. So that's 5, 10, 15, yeah, more enough movement. That's lavender rack. Yeah, okay, no. Uh, disadvantage. That's 16.

[Speaker 1]
And the second attack is a 14.

[Speaker 2]
So, one headphones here.

[Speaker 1]
Wait, if it, if it's 16, if I have AC 16 goes, it

[Speaker 4]
Hits it of them both. Hit he's dead.

[Speaker 1]
Oh,

[Speaker 2]
The 14 doesn't hit. 16 and 14 yeah, 16

[Speaker 1]
And 14. Oh, the first one

[Speaker 3]
Is okay.

[Speaker 1]
That's uh, 20, 22 points

[Speaker 2]
Half to 11.

[Speaker 1]
Half to 11. He's alive,

[Speaker 2]
Two HP baby

[Speaker 1]
Plus plus four points of damage. He's not

[Speaker 2]
Alive. Um, how did that four points come, uh,

[Speaker 4]
It's just 38 plus four?

[Speaker 2]
Oh yeah. Actually, plus two, so it's

[Speaker 1]
Yeah,

[Speaker 2]
Exactly.

[Speaker 1]
Exactly, uh, lavender goes down as he's fighting off two Ben Barrels at the same time he gets in circular. I mean, he could be brought back. Still, he could be brought back, uh, that's kite.

[Speaker 2]
All right, I will.

[Speaker 1]
Stand

[Speaker 2]
Up. And then.

[Speaker 1]
I

[Speaker 2]
Can move to here.

[Speaker 1]
Yep, and that's an arrangement, right? Yeah.

[Speaker 2]
And then. I guess I'll just. There you go swimming again. I will recklessly attack.

[Speaker 2]
Um, I will. Uh, does anyone want to move? No, okay.

[Speaker 4]
If you are,

[Speaker 1]
I'll take movement. You're you're safe

[Speaker 2]
Here. Um, I mean, if you want it, I think you can have it.

[Speaker 1]
I mean, do you lose anything for it? I

[Speaker 2]
Only did two more of these. Oh, again, that's fine. Okay, let's keep it moving.

[Speaker 2]
Uh, six, and 16 damage to this guy got it. And then you go around him, got it, and then I will. He is barely hurt. He's gonna be the way, yeah. I will use my second attack on him. And. This one. Does seven damage got?

[Speaker 1]
Cool!

[Speaker 4]
Okay, fantastic. Uh, that's going to be,

[Speaker 1]
Uh, vampires. 2 legendaries action? Uh, he's going to move. Towards here, and he's going to trample again, so that's going to be. The three four in the middle here.

[Speaker 1]
Sure, yeah, go for it.

[Speaker 2]
So he doesn't actually move.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, oh

[Speaker 3]
My goodness, you look fucking hero,

[Speaker 2]
But now I'm definitely gonna give you your movement because that gets doubled as well.

[Speaker 9]
You're actually doing so much. I would have been long that,

[Speaker 1]
Uh,

[Speaker 2]
And he has to do this one.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah.

[Speaker 4]
You tell me lavender has to do constitution,

[Speaker 1]
He Autumn. He Auto fails it, uh, he means like he takes two points of.

[Speaker 2]
No, he takes an extra D12 that doesn't get doubled. No, but

[Speaker 1]
If he, if he takes damage while you're down, you automatically fail to death, save, and throws. Wait, does lavender have to do it? Lavender is down. He can't succeeds the Constitution, saying, throw.

[Speaker 2]
See the Constitutional favor because he's down.

[Speaker 1]
I don't think you can roll a constitution. Say anything when you're downed. Let's see.

[Speaker 1]
Uh, unconscious, incapacitated. Uh, County actions reactions automatically fails strength and dexterity setting throws so he can roll the Constitution saving throw. It's so weird, that's very weird. My girlfriend

[Speaker 2]
14, which is plus to Constitution

[Speaker 1]
Four. It's a 50, 50, 50.

[Speaker 1]
Uh, ouch.

[Speaker 2]
Sorry, lavender.

[Speaker 1]
Well, that might be the end for him. No,

[Speaker 4]
Wait, no.

[Speaker 3]
Is he, like, dead dead? No,

[Speaker 2]
He takes two, yes.

[Speaker 1]
Go to three. I'm pretty sure I'm pretty sure that's how it works. You know what we? We will find out. And

[Speaker 2]
No, why don't you just take? I think you just take one, don't you?

[Speaker 1]
Uh, let me check.

[Speaker 2]
Is it a crit? Does it too, doesn't it?

[Speaker 1]
Uh, let me talk best saving throws because here it actually matters.

[Speaker 1]
Uh, yeah, critical are two failures, uh, it's one failure.

[Speaker 2]
Um, I don't know, so his movement is now zero, yes, and EK. 18. 27, 28, 32, plus 6 is 38 damage

[Speaker 1]
Holy.

[Speaker 4]
Uh,

[Speaker 1]
Okay, and it's happened. They can't be a treatment they can't actually. Yeah, he takes a big chunk of damage. Lavender is on the ground, just like he is bleeding out. And as he's bleeding out, Lavender just shakes him on the ground. He still does get to make this trample attack, however, so I'm gonna need everyone, including lavender, automatically fails his dexterity so I didn't throw. So, it's lavender kite, uh, bitey, and Sorrell.

[Speaker 2]
Is, is

[Speaker 1]
Silver? How big is the range on it? It's 30 feet. That's 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30. The ten. The five feet of moving, yeah?

[Speaker 1]
So still real. You're good, but I'm gonna need fighting. That's really crazy. Uh, Dexterity, second throw. However, he's already down. Yeah, so he fails. He takes one, uh, debt Saving Pro.

[Speaker 2]
What is the save? I

[Speaker 1]
Mean, uh, it's the x18. 28 points of blood in English.

[Speaker 1]
Okay. Uh, that's going to be. So that was kite's turn, right? No, was it? What turn

[Speaker 9]
Of it,

[Speaker 1]
Okay, right? No Skates.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, it was mine. Oh, everyone takes half damage on on that. Guys, this guy's taking half out of it.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, so you only take.

[Speaker 2]
No, no one, wait, it only matters for me. I don't do anything okay?

[Speaker 1]
Uh, or sorry, it's silver. That's your turn. Okay. How much your speed you have, uh, 18, okay?

[Speaker 2]
So?

[Speaker 9]
Talk to you! Reckon how hard is this guy so instantly, right? I can tell you,

[Speaker 1]
Uh. This guy here is under a third. So he's, he still has more than two-thirds of his, he likes. Uh, this guy is at about half. Okay, do

[Speaker 9]
You reckon he's half is 50?

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, oh, 50 hit points.

[Speaker 9]
Yeah, no.

[Speaker 2]
I don't think so. Because he did 80 hit points to that guy. I think they're like

[Speaker 1]
170. Like you, you do a lot of damage with

[Speaker 2]
The banishing Smite, don't you?

[Speaker 9]
I do. I do. I

[Speaker 2]
Think

[Speaker 9]
It's worth it or what I have. I have to spell slots now for some reason, so I'm just gonna do it flag someone. Okay, so Macham. Is next time you hit a creature. Okay, I

[Speaker 1]
Will tell you right now. You need to do a crazy. I mean, we're gonna stick to get better. You can still cast it. I will still be damaged.

[Speaker 2]
Sometimes, you do do crazy enough. Well, you can. Can you choose to do? Is it like the Calder one where you can choose after you hit, I think

[Speaker 1]
So? Yeah,

[Speaker 2]
At least see if you get it, crit. If you get a crate, it should probably do it

[Speaker 9]
True, true. Okay, first of all, I'm a hexist guy. Tax blades first. So I got a plus 40 damage rolls, and if I and I score a critical hit on 19 or 20. Okay now.

[Speaker 9]
Those 26 hits.

[Speaker 2]
Are you gonna do the danishing or no?

[Speaker 9]
Sonic credit. I'm not gonna do it. Get multiple tracks. Yes, I'm going to do a second track in a second, so 12. 14 points of damage. Tom this guy, right? Yes. And

[Speaker 1]
Second

[Speaker 9]
Term.

[Speaker 1]
Oh,

[Speaker 9]
Fuck.

[Speaker 9]
Okay, let's try. I should have managed this time.

[Speaker 1]
Lavender is going to roll a death saving throne.

[Speaker 2]
Is an actual like if he fails, he dies. If he gets in that one, he dies

[Speaker 1]
No. If he fails, he dies. That's right. Guys! This is 50 50. Or

[Speaker 2]
Exactly 70, 50, because,

[Speaker 9]
Oh no, lavender! You were about to win this potentially one, maybe?

[Speaker 9]
You know, he's gone.

[Speaker 9]
Boy, I love anymore. It's like, interpretation of lavender, oh no. The hopeful kid,

[Speaker 1]
Robin, is so happy right now. Um,

[Speaker 9]
Oh gosh,

[Speaker 1]
You guys sent this young bright-eyed kid into the melee to fight some monsters for you. And hey, he wanted to. We told him to say that he was Bright Eyes, uh? Foolish. However, he got caught in the crossfire of your own weapons, I will say. Uh, twice, and he just bleeds out on the floor.

[Speaker 9]
Jesus Christ. What happens

[Speaker 3]
When you fight amongst powerful? This

[Speaker 9]
Is like the most favorite fight of this entire campaign as well. Look, if

[Speaker 3]
He's not strong enough to handle like, you know, this

[Speaker 9]
Is the Hungarian

[Speaker 2]
Wildland

[Speaker 3]
Exactly.

[Speaker 1]
If

[Speaker 3]
You can't handle our collateral, I don't think he was strong enough to party up.

[Speaker 1]
My boy just died.

[Speaker 2]
Come on. You guys hired him, right? Yeah, I got in there boy. Oh, he died

[Speaker 9]
His fault.

[Speaker 1]
I think the middle came to him honestly. Yeah, yeah, I think he's dirty here. Well, that's gonna be lavender gone. Um,

[Speaker 2]
No, no,

[Speaker 1]
Uh, Meg, that would be your turn.

[Speaker 1]
It's essentially all of these guys will fit. It's a third-up spear, so all of our teammates, I will heal you for coming.

[Speaker 1]
Isn't it around you, or do

[Speaker 2]
You

[Speaker 4]
Change

[Speaker 2]
What it is? How much

[Speaker 9]
30

[Speaker 1]
For 30. Damn 30 points of healing to everyone? Yep,

[Speaker 9]
Let's go,

[Speaker 1]
Actually, but not not. Uh, what's his name? That's okay. Don't worry about it. Hold on. Have a look. It's like 12 points of hours or something. Six. Yeah, they'd save well. I don't know, oh bitey. Oh yeah, thank you for reminding me

[Speaker 9]
Friday is going to. Like one turn too late for her to say, yes, that's right. What the shit what? Why didn't you do it earlier because you don't want to die?

[Speaker 2]
It was just very unfortunate that.

[Speaker 1]
Lavender was almost full HP left,

[Speaker 9]
I'm sorry, oh,

[Speaker 1]
It's okay. No,

[Speaker 4]
No, he's been slowly taking damage every single time, like they did the trample thing he took like 20 something points of damage? Yeah,

[Speaker 1]
Uh, that's gonna be u.

[Speaker 1]
This member is going to turn on still real and make two attacks against you so real. Okay? Uh. Uh, that's gonna be. So, that's an 18 and a 17.

[Speaker 9]
Thank you for healing me 30, yeah.

[Speaker 4]
Uh, so.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, yeah. Did you get them backward? Or no,

[Speaker 1]
You're that far as long.

[Speaker 1]
It does use up all my board level spells. Oh.

[Speaker 1]
Oh yeah, sorry about that 21, so 27. 27, uh, that's. Sorry, I'm yeah, 27, 37, oh, 46.

[Speaker 9]
45.

[Speaker 1]
Uh, that's. 50, I'm done 54.7 hours.

[Speaker 1]
So, with one attack with its hip and one attack with its horn. Just knocks you onto the ground. So, what is prone? Oh, not, not just down. Yeah. There are threes.

[Speaker 2]
No, that was, Pandora, yeah,

[Speaker 1]
Yeah. So it's adorable dumpster. Now, this

[Speaker 3]
Is actually harder than one. Then,

[Speaker 2]
It's harder than I thought.

[Speaker 9]
We probably got stronger guys. We could just

[Speaker 2]
It just snail them.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, we should be able to finish them off. Can

[Speaker 2]
Anyone heal him before his turn?

[Speaker 1]
Any of us have healing potions.

[Speaker 9]
That's okay, I can do it, I can. I can survive a couple I

[Speaker 3]
Have.

[Speaker 2]
You can't do your matching, I

[Speaker 3]
Feel worse. Yeah, keep

[Speaker 1]
In mind, they have legendary actions every time you get caught in one of those. Damage and like them. You understand what I mean. Okay, I'm gonna use

[Speaker 3]
Healing word on. You got it. That heals for eight. Oh, thank you.

[Speaker 1]
He goes down. He gets back up. He comes down. He gets back up.

[Speaker 3]
And. The single Target damage. I really don't have that much.

[Speaker 1]
After that is,

[Speaker 3]
I've got a fire bolt again.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, perfect. Which one are you targeting?

[Speaker 3]
Oh, wait, who am I targeting? Now, they're either way it's a 16. I don't think either it does not hit. Yeah, okay.

[Speaker 1]
One is more fucked up. Uh, by, uh, quite a big margin. Okay, yeah, okay. Uh, last time, what's wrong? Hi, Michelle stealth coming action?

[Speaker 4]
Here, and I'm gonna go up here.

[Speaker 1]
Isn't that funny? Oh, that's stealth,

[Speaker 4]
And I'm in. I'm invisible, he's not

[Speaker 2]
Funny stuff. Oh,

[Speaker 1]
Like, a Whisper in the Wind, and then I

[Speaker 4]
Take a.

[Speaker 1]
There's 18 head makes us fuck. Goes white. Is that your turn?

[Speaker 4]
That's it Vanderborough

[Speaker 1]
2! On kite. Now that's the closest Target.

[Speaker 2]
Fight movement is zero until the start of my next turn. Okay, it

[Speaker 1]
Doesn't matter. Yeah, you're still in Ranger. As Advantage to be Reckless.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, it doesn't matter, it just can't really. One, two.

[Speaker 1]
It's, it's okay. Uh, all the D12. Uh, that's.

[Speaker 2]
22, two separate attacks matters for the rounding down 23,

[Speaker 1]
Okay, 18. Doesn't matter, yeah,

[Speaker 2]
Cuz they could. I could get an extra hit point if it's on.

[Speaker 1]
Okay. Hey, I lost track. Okay, let me let me go and

[Speaker 2]
Whatever these ones.

[Speaker 1]
Um, 15, oh my God, sorry! Uh, so that's 24, 27, so 27 is the first one that was one

[Speaker 2]
At six. Six D12 is one attack.

[Speaker 1]
No, just, uh, it's 3D 12 is one second.

[Speaker 2]
First, one was 18. You grew up.

[Speaker 1]
I'm I'm re-rolling because I lost track of how many I had. So, this is the first attack, so that's 24 plus six is 30.

[Speaker 2]
24 plus 6 is

[Speaker 1]
30. So, that's 15 points to the end, right? Okay. And the next one is four. Ah, so that's 16 22.

[Speaker 1]
That's 22 plus 9 31 points of Legend gouge. We're just 15 again, so you take 30 points of damage total. Sound good?

[Speaker 1]
Okay, that's your turn.

[Speaker 2]
All right, what is the? We got one down. You guys can still run away. That's what I'm about to to bring out. Do you got? What are you guys feeling right now?

[Speaker 3]
I've been running away is a good option.

[Speaker 4]
Um. I mean, what are we going to do about toll road?

[Speaker 2]
Alive right now, right?

[Speaker 9]
Yeah, we've run away.

[Speaker 3]
Does right away mean we don't get to pick whatever we want.

[Speaker 1]
You only get to pick one. You'll, we'll consider that you leave here. You recuperate, you come back for the body, and then you harvest what you want. I mean, this guy

[Speaker 4]
Is on the third of his HP, right?

[Speaker 9]
Yeah,

[Speaker 2]
No, this guy has one third damage. This guy's about half. Yeah, but it was like a turn ago. Yeah, so,

[Speaker 1]
But

[Speaker 2]
We haven't done much since then, so you

[Speaker 9]
Reckon we can focus this guy down, and then

[Speaker 1]
I think so.

[Speaker 9]
Oh, banishing. Slide them toys.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah. I have a feeling that Damazon would be nice to us.

[Speaker 1]
I'm perfectly fair.

[Speaker 1]
What do you think?

[Speaker 9]
Should we please?

[Speaker 1]
I think we should play just because we can't long rice, and we still have other guys with a lot of fight.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, I agree with that.

[Speaker 2]
Because I think we're about to die.

[Speaker 9]
Okay,

[Speaker 2]
Well, I think me, and you are both about to death. Oh, I have deaf War.

[Speaker 1]
Uh, still, though,

[Speaker 3]
We should probably flee. We only have one, doesn't work right. I mean, you don't. We can't keep that warning, and we've got more fights to do.

[Speaker 2]
We do 5, 10, 15, 10, 23.

[Speaker 2]
I think I need to. This guys, this is the one that can hit you. So I'll go around over here. And then I will. Uh, attack it requisite attack.

[Speaker 2]
Can I meet you guys? Have a?

[Speaker 1]
You're getting out of range of his attack range, though. I'm gonna take an attack of opportunities.

[Speaker 2]
An idea I can't be within range of both of them so?

[Speaker 2]
Well, here at eight HP, right?

[Speaker 1]
It's all wrong.

[Speaker 2]
And HP. I think even if you have resistance, it's not going to help you no.

[Speaker 2]
Wait, I. I think Gage isn't is an action.

[Speaker 4]
Yes,

[Speaker 1]
For

[Speaker 2]
You, it is all right. I will action surge to disengage and then get over here.

[Speaker 1]
Um, and then.

[Speaker 2]
Then I get my full attacks on this guy. Got it.

[Speaker 1]
Um.

[Speaker 1]
Actively

[Speaker 2]
Attack obviously. Uh, yeah.

[Speaker 1]
Um.

[Speaker 2]
I'll do it on. You want to move away from it or no?

[Speaker 9]
I want to see if we can brush it down in one term.

[Speaker 4]
I think the three of us can, if I get off another attack, I think

[Speaker 9]
So.

[Speaker 2]
If I, if you didn't attack instead of me for my next one, would you be able to do a lot more damage?

[Speaker 4]
I mean for this Tech shot. Yeah, because I can do a

[Speaker 2]
Thing where, instead of my attack, I

[Speaker 1]
Roll for your attack.

[Speaker 4]
So I would take the shot. You would take the shot instead. Can I does? Can I do like a sneak attack with that?

[Speaker 2]
Hey, you got, you're still hidden, right? Yeah, but you use your sink attack when you're going to hit him. Could you banishing what? How do you have? How do you cast bashings like so

[Speaker 9]
The attack has the head first? And then it's a bonus action. It's a 5G 10. Extra damage, heavy heads. Additionally, if it reduces that down to 50 HP, it just vanished. Yeah,

[Speaker 4]
We don't think it's, I don't even think it's a bonus actually.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, so you can do that on my transfogular commanding strike?

[Speaker 1]
Yep, sure.

[Speaker 4]
Okay, nope.

[Speaker 2]
I'll just do a normal attack over. I already hit my motorcycle. Um. For seven damage. And then. I will do a commanding attack where I roll for your to hit sport.

[Speaker 9]
Okay, I quit at a 19 or 20. M, plus four to damage rules.

[Speaker 2]
I should have done a circle for them, and you get an extra D8 on

[Speaker 1]
What I mean, so. Eight, unfortunate, not a great,

[Speaker 2]
But I'm still you. Should I think he's still banish?

[Speaker 9]
To damage rolls. What does that mean,

[Speaker 2]
So you plus more damage?

[Speaker 1]
And yeah, a tackle or damage rules damage

[Speaker 9]
Rolls.

[Speaker 4]
Oh yeah, you just do an extra four points damage, so?

[Speaker 2]
So, just forget about that MPM. Go ahead for

[Speaker 9]
So forgot about the hit DC. I just rolled for damage now. Correct? It is. Six, plus a d10. If the weapon comes in,

[Speaker 2]
So

[Speaker 9]
That's ten plus a plus, plus four damage from this. So, 14. Fortune from the weapon. Okay, another cast Vanishing Smite.

[Speaker 2]
I'm sorry, and you cast it at max level, right?

[Speaker 9]
Uh, I think it's one level. Please test that in your cell

[Speaker 1]
Phone. Is that 24 points down

[Speaker 9]
20, 457? Okay, those are reduces to 50.

[Speaker 2]
Doesn't your, uh, you have to do the Banshee fight after school, right? So he does, yeah. Not quite okay. Well, I can finish. Well,

[Speaker 1]
That's okay.

[Speaker 2]
Well, you have another one you do, right? Yeah.

[Speaker 9]
I got two more.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, perfect if that Skype's turn, then that's so will turn. So wait,

[Speaker 9]
Uh?

[Speaker 2]
I'm gonna see if that entertainment might notice action. Can you is potions a voice action you drinking?

[Speaker 4]
One is

[Speaker 1]
Drinking. One is administering one as an action. Got it, uh?

[Speaker 9]
I think that's the that's the strap.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, I'm I might as well kill.

[Speaker 1]
I believe if it's 1d8 plus something.

[Speaker 4]
It's 1d4 plus four,

[Speaker 1]
One, B, four, plus four. Yeah, that sounds small, uh, it's 2d4, plus two, yeah.

[Speaker 2]
Plus three, two,

[Speaker 4]
Three. That was like eight different companies, and I rolled two ones.

[Speaker 1]
Nice. This member is gonna use this legendary action, uh? And is going to just move slightly here so that it can hit everyone with its trample one, two, three, um. Yeah, so that's well, lavender's already dead. That's kite, and uh, please,

[Speaker 9]
Fucking fuck man. Oh, thank God.

[Speaker 4]
It saves, however, you're still going to take half damage. Oh

[Speaker 9]
True, um,

[Speaker 1]
But we'll see if you manage to survive.

[Speaker 2]
I did not say it.

[Speaker 1]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
That is 4d10. We got this,

[Speaker 2]
Guys! You guys got this.

[Speaker 1]
Ah, 1724, 24 points of budgeting half to 12. You go down. Yeah, cell rolls down.

[Speaker 4]
No why?

[Speaker 2]
Wait, wait! Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,

[Speaker 1]
Wait,

[Speaker 2]
Wait, wait! Looking at the?

[Speaker 1]
Not be down Meg.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, I can. I can use my reaction to reduce your damage by 2d6. No fucking. Why seven HP less so? It was, how much was it? So

[Speaker 9]
It says 24, 12, so we take five, five, six.

[Speaker 4]
That's right, yeah.

[Speaker 2]
Granny jumps in. It's like.

[Speaker 9]
Outlet most alive right now. Like, clearly, at the brink of death.

[Speaker 1]
So, Lily's being baby bye?

[Speaker 1]
All of all of Christ's grandparents are constantly surrounding you. It is taking

[Speaker 9]
Hits for you. How many grandparents do you have?

[Speaker 1]
Okay, uh, yeah, that's your turn solo.

[Speaker 9]
Okay, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right.

[Speaker 1]
So, is that a limited resource, or what? Yes, I can't. It's as your reaction, but you can do that, every turn, yeah,

[Speaker 2]
Okay.

[Speaker 9]
26, to hit.

[Speaker 2]
I mean, it also can't opportunity to attack Dentistry.

[Speaker 1]
Sorry,

[Speaker 9]
26, the hit it's?

[Speaker 1]
Uh, 43 points a damage to it

[Speaker 9]
Before it go down to 50.

[Speaker 1]
No, it has 43 if you like,

[Speaker 2]
Oh, so, like it banished them

[Speaker 9]
Out as the fucking guy. Yeah, but

[Speaker 2]
See if you can kill it. Let's see even better. Okay, so 15

[Speaker 9]
Plus.

[Speaker 1]
So

[Speaker 9]
That's 17 plus 4 21, all right 21,

[Speaker 1]
21, and then

[Speaker 9]
Banishing Smite.

[Speaker 1]
38, yeah, so that's

[Speaker 9]
38 from the. Yeah, there's 10 hit points remaining.

[Speaker 2]
Um.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, I mean, I won't make you play out. Like the retreat, you are faster than a Ben Baro on average. Um, and since, it's like all of you, you get up,

[Speaker 2]
Really.

[Speaker 4]
Are you, okay, let's do

[Speaker 2]
That? Thank you, we.

[Speaker 3]
We need to great job, guys.

[Speaker 9]
Uh,

[Speaker 6]
Or are we no, you're

[Speaker 1]
Good. You're great.

[Speaker 9]
Okay.

[Speaker 3]
Yes, but before we do that, do you want to use the rest of your spell slots on the guns?

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, the ones like, what is your spell slot level, uh, six, yes, good?

[Speaker 9]
One, okay,

[Speaker 2]
You get, you get one. So,

[Speaker 1]
Just to be clear, I've changed the guns. Uh, you need to refresh them in your inventory, so you delete them and re-add them to see what I've changed. But just to be clear, the spell slot level goes down with time, I believe. At the moment, I set it for a day. It might change to an hour. This lighter Euro right now.

[Speaker 2]
I'm

[Speaker 1]
Letting you know, right now.

[Speaker 2]
I,

[Speaker 1]
I made it like, uh, my mind was, like, I want this thing to be cool. For spellcasters who want an option to do for an option to do, like, you know, yeah,

[Speaker 4]
Spell it like action

[Speaker 1]
Facts. I didn't think of the possibility of being like, here you go.

[Speaker 10]
Get our little army yeah, because our army of spellcaster, yeah,

[Speaker 4]
You. So it'll still be viable. They'll get me wrong.

[Speaker 2]
So, because we're going to take this short rest? Enough to knock it down.

[Speaker 1]
No, so for now. I'll say it's a day, so you guys can do whatever the fuck you want. These combats are like for you guys to, you know, have fun, have a little bit more confident stuff. Let's let's,

[Speaker 3]
Um. One level six spell slot remaining yeah, who?

[Speaker 9]
Who wants

[Speaker 3]
It? Yeah, charge up charge up another one of his guns.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah,

[Speaker 2]
We. I think these two should get a hold. Yeah,

[Speaker 4]
I, I have enough, but the one problem is, I can't like shoot and swap guns at the same turn. All right, at least I think I can. Yeah, let me look, I think theoretically, I could do.

[Speaker 4]
Um, I think with five e rules. What I can do is, if I have it on my back, I could technically shoot and drop the gun on the floor and then the next turn. I can draw and shoot and drop. I can't sheath it, but I can drop it on sheath constantly. Yeah,

[Speaker 2]
Drawing a weapon is an object contraction, though.

[Speaker 1]
It's really confusing, um?

[Speaker 1]
So from the new rules. You can draw or see the weapon every time you attack bro.

[Speaker 4]
So? Am I just like double bumping?

[Speaker 1]
Ah, okay, it's fine. Yeah, uh, I will say, uh. For this weapon, specifically, you wouldn't be able to. Swap it and shoot it twice. Yeah, two in

[Speaker 2]
One turn seems

[Speaker 1]
Kind of kind of broken.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, I can't shoot twice anyways. Yeah, but

[Speaker 1]
You, I will say you can shoot it. Like, just like it on your back and take your crossbow or whatever. Like,

[Speaker 4]
Or can I like shoot one and then drop it and the next turn? Draw a second one and shoot it. Yes, okay, that's all I needed to do. That sounds fair to me all right

[Speaker 3]
Now that we know that. So, next level slot,

[Speaker 4]
How many

[Speaker 3]
Guns do you have in your inventory? Oh, God.

[Speaker 4]
Oh God, I have. Currently, they're just sitting there in charge. I've got four, and in my inventory, I have one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, more. Okay,

[Speaker 3]
Add another two fifth levels.

[Speaker 4]
Okay, okay, let's let's calm down. The

[Speaker 10]
Issue is if they miss, it still absorbs and smells fine, which is, what's sad, yeah,

[Speaker 4]
Yeah. Which,

[Speaker 3]
Which is fine, wait,

[Speaker 2]
Wait! This is a short rest. You don't get all your spelled back on a short arrest. You, yeah,

[Speaker 4]
I know.

[Speaker 2]
You should. You should keep yours, but you should because I can still shoot my weapon and still deal that

[Speaker 3]
Okay, instead of no, not, the fifth one revert the fifth level spell.

[Speaker 9]
Dude, what are you talking?

[Speaker 4]
We should still have four loaded ones, which is six, six,

[Speaker 3]
Four teleportation servers, but but I'm just saying fourth level spell slots just add three more four double spell slot guns, okay, and be very use them a lot. Okay, okay.

[Speaker 3]
You can get more, get a little bit more loot if we.

[Speaker 1]
Let's do a

[Speaker 3]
Test limit testing, right? Guys, exactly.

[Speaker 8]
So, as uh is it long, are we taking a short rest and then level

[Speaker 9]
Six gone to you.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, okay,

[Speaker 1]
So a few things, uh, first of all, which, uh. Are you picking from the table,

[Speaker 9]
Uh, fucking whatever?

[Speaker 10]
Is allowed to have any party. Would it be possible that he's allowed any of this stuff with adjustments up to your discretion, or can you? Should I just go buy him like normal stuff? I

[Speaker 1]
Think that's a great idea if he wants to wear the skit of his enemies as armor. I think that's absolutely sick, and he

[Speaker 4]
Should do that. It's sick as fuck.

[Speaker 10]
Well, if we've already killed this guy. Anyways, the Pandora who player of his could be, wait, I was

[Speaker 9]
Gonna.

[Speaker 3]
The scale armor, though, right? Yeah,

[Speaker 9]
If we're gonna get to it, are we will? We will we get to it? You can decide later.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, it's not like, we're gonna get it now. Yeah, you're

[Speaker 10]
Right. Is

[Speaker 2]
Someone keeping track of all the loot? Yeah,

[Speaker 9]
No, these should be the lootmaster.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, I've

[Speaker 10]
I've stopped doing that. I'll write down like heal near the end so I can use them near the beginning.

[Speaker 1]
Possibility. If you forget, that's not my fault. But I think, uh, so far, you guys have been on track with that.

[Speaker 2]
So far, we keep forgetting. And then we remind each other.

[Speaker 1]
Next question, yes, that's correct. Yes, so can you,

[Speaker 9]
Uh,

[Speaker 2]
Can

[Speaker 9]
You equip the super heavy Warhammer now?

[Speaker 2]
To make it first.

[Speaker 9]
Oh yeah, okay, I

[Speaker 10]
Have it. I'm writing this down in the.

[Speaker 2]
I have what we want, what we've gotten.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, do

[Speaker 2]
You have all of them? I

[Speaker 10]
Don't have the ones we've already made, so we

[Speaker 2]
Have the blow gun from the balcony, scroll up to the bubble guy.

[Speaker 1]
I believe I actually removed it entirely. From my notes,

[Speaker 2]
And that's not our fault.

[Speaker 4]
You all right.

[Speaker 2]
They also have, do you guys still have the dragon cooking? Yes, yes.

[Speaker 9]
You should, uh, you should give that to.

[Speaker 4]
I think we can figure it out later, right?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah,

[Speaker 3]
I have a I have ten charges still. Ten,

[Speaker 9]
You mean 10 bags of Coke?

[Speaker 1]
In my notes somewhere, don't worry about it too much. I'll give you the information for it.

[Speaker 2]
Really fire malt, the Beetlejuice Mall.

[Speaker 9]
Yeah, that's something I might sitting as how fast I'm going down. I don't know if I should use it, but.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, okay.

[Speaker 1]
Um, as you guys flee the battle Riku and eventually come back. Lavender's body is lying there on the

[Speaker 3]
Floor. Anyone no reanimate dead?

[Speaker 1]
You guys decided that it was not a spell in this world.

[Speaker 3]
Oh right, um?

[Speaker 1]
If the body is lying there, what you want to do?

[Speaker 9]
Try him,

[Speaker 2]
I think. Yeah, the tradition of agarian Hunters is to air them at the site of of

[Speaker 4]
Death. How old was he?

[Speaker 1]
He was young. He was a young Dragonborn. He was in his 20s.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah.

[Speaker 4]
I

[Speaker 3]
Kind of. I walk up to him. You know,

[Speaker 4]
I put my hand over his face, and I close his eyes. And then I reach into, like my backpack, and I take out the one scale of the the green dragon. Obviously, and I put it like in his hand. Lay up to rest.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, you guys bury him.

[Speaker 9]
Probably, we thought for some sort of. Like, prayer for? Mila yeah, because he literally died in war.

[Speaker 1]
Yep, but

[Speaker 9]
I think my? Actually, I know my little one. Plus them into his afterlife. So

[Speaker 1]
Absolutely, as you start like Whispering a prayer near his body, you do feel like that sort of divine connection to yourself, and you feel like the the Flames that are now enveloping, like your ears. And I believe also other parts of your body. Start growing like a little bit stronger, and you feel like this kind of divine connection as you're praying there. Uh, this was, uh. I mean, this combat wasn't necessary, uh, but he still gave it us all. And that's something viola would respect. Anyways,

[Speaker 4]
Yes, 100.

[Speaker 2]
I have a question I probably should have asked before we did this.

[Speaker 3]
My brother, yeah.

[Speaker 1]
So that's the other thing, um? I assume you guys put him in a safe place as you're doing this, and then come back to get him. Um. He is in a very similar state as he was before, uh, just very curious around the world. It's an odd thing to see a person who is effectively in an adult's body, uh, but behave effectively like a toddler. It is quite odd. As you guys are traveling and kind of coming back, um, I will say. Adorable dog, you think more and more about how you can potentially solve this condition of his?

[Speaker 1]
Make another Arcana or medicine jacket okay?

[Speaker 4]
22.

[Speaker 1]
You think there is a very strong possibility that you can potentially unravel, uh, Phineas memory? However, you don't know what the effect will be to your own memory or personhood.

[Speaker 9]
Oh, okay.

[Speaker 1]
But normal Dame's never shined away from, uh, experimenting with himself.

[Speaker 3]
One considers this. He makes up his mind to, uh, speak with kite later tonight.

[Speaker 4]
You

[Speaker 1]
Guys continue traveling, and eventually you find a place to rest, um, so as for like the the rules, uh, you got a short rest, but you guys set up camp and everything. Um, so all of you can Mark a short rest, and um. Uh, Jordan. If you wanted to talk to Kate?

[Speaker 10]
Click for the short rest. You're gonna be playing a song of rest, which is for short rest specifically, so

[Speaker 4]
Anyone can

[Speaker 10]
Hear that gets an extra 1v8 hit points. What happened?

[Speaker 2]
Do we all roll a separate one year? Yeah,

[Speaker 10]
Everyone's up, right?

[Speaker 9]
So, for this, is it just depending on how many hours we rest is how much a heel or was this

[Speaker 2]
So you can choose

[Speaker 10]
You choose.

[Speaker 2]
Choose how many of you are eight dice you want to use, but you don't get your face back because half in the back of the long press.

[Speaker 2]
I'm going to pretty much fully heal, I think.

[Speaker 3]
Don't eat anything because?

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, can you use them

[Speaker 2]
And then see how much you get and then use more, or do you have to choose ahead of time?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, sure, mine didn't

[Speaker 4]
Work. It. It's really weird. Just do it manually. Yeah, one

[Speaker 9]
D. Each is 1d8 plus three, so it's so I've used five minutes five, the eight plus 15.

[Speaker 4]
Oh wait, no,

[Speaker 9]
Yeah, 5d8, plus three. No, it it's, it went up.

[Speaker 3]
I'm using my phone.

[Speaker 9]
Me.

[Speaker 6]
Dude, I need more.

[Speaker 10]
You also have 1v8 from me an extra

[Speaker 9]
Okay. Appreciate it so 38 plus six.

[Speaker 9]
Problem

[Speaker 3]
During the short rest. Andrew under a tree purple dumb walks over to kite, you know? Which is robe and and his, uh, his pointy hat? No, he's looking quite different from the garbage covered Vagabond that. He once was just, I guess, like a week ago. I think at least two weeks in this month in his hand, instead of a two by four, with nails sticking out of it. It's, uh, that's gone.

[Speaker 4]
Exactly.

[Speaker 3]
He hobbles over.

[Speaker 4]
Good news, Kai, I've.

[Speaker 3]
I've been thinking about her brother's condition. And with what remains is my my memory of memory magic? I think there is a way for me to. Unzip the memories of your brother here is! It'll be difficult. I need to make labor user performance enhancing substances. There's some risk, but it'll be fine.

[Speaker 4]
That sounds like

[Speaker 2]
A positive for you. It's.

[Speaker 3]
I deal with no reason. And it's healthier if I have a good reason for it. It becomes less of a habit and more of like, you know, instead of being. Some guy using it. I become like Lance Armstrong, you know, like, or house or house house.

[Speaker 4]
I'm on

[Speaker 3]
Drugs, and I'm good at my job. So,

[Speaker 6]
It is it,

[Speaker 2]
Lucas. Part, is it Lupus?

[Speaker 3]
No?

[Speaker 9]
It's not Ludacris.

[Speaker 2]
But if there's anything you can do, I would I'd be in your debt forever

[Speaker 3]
Tonight. When we rest when we retire for the evening, I'd like to give it a try. It may be risky, but. I think with, you know, the right amount of luck? And drugs drugs. I think we can get your brother back.

[Speaker 2]
Uh, a single tier means to. All down tight space. He. Wipes away. Tries to like, click on and stuff. It's

[Speaker 3]
Very unbarbaric over you. This is this is this cat lady. He's been a great adventure, but you know, it's about time I I gave back to you for pulling me out of the garbage pile that one time I

[Speaker 2]
Wasn't there.

[Speaker 7]
Right?

[Speaker 3]
Actually, I like to think about you. Weren't there?

[Speaker 1]
Would totally not remember that, yeah,

[Speaker 3]
You know, I don't know when, when each of you came along? In my notes, there was a word of this funny fellow. Uh, when a talking horse? I don't know what he's doing, but you know, I've been invented to that guy as well, so? Okay, I'll pay it forward.

[Speaker 2]
And. Kate puts her hand on his shoulder and says. Really are? A true friend, Bubbledon I, I can't thank you

[Speaker 4]
Enough.

[Speaker 3]
Hey, don't mention it. It'll be fine. I'm just going to do what I'm going to do mess around with people's memories. Use stuff and have a good time while doing it.

[Speaker 4]
He's been inside my head, and it worked out fine. Yeah.

[Speaker 3]
I've been inside all of our hands.

[Speaker 2]
So right now. You're going inside my party! Go!

[Speaker 4]
Oh.

[Speaker 9]
Literally, the softest Barbarian of the constant

[Speaker 3]
Normal down was jovial demeanor. He it kind of takes a, takes

[Speaker 8]
A back seat. He, uh, looks tight that tight in your eye goes, you know?

[Speaker 3]
For all those times, you've you and your ancestors. Have saved me. Good one for you. I would be. An old man, like me, would never make it conscious battles.

[Speaker 2]
You telling yourself for short, but I'm glad I could help you. Thank you.

[Speaker 1]
Phineas is kind of on this side. He's played with the Fang that you gave him. Totally distracted, doesn't really know what's going on around him.

[Speaker 9]
The way over here. This conversation at all, it's

[Speaker 1]
Up to you.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, we're not, we're just. I just walked up to kite, so this is within your shot of everyone.

[Speaker 4]
So, how does this work?

[Speaker 3]
No, we? Well, we're not doing it yet, are we? We still have monsters to hunt.

[Speaker 2]
That is true.

[Speaker 9]
Well, let's have the button and let him do. This thing looks like he needs some space.

[Speaker 2]
If there's anything I can do to? Healthy

[Speaker 3]
At all at any cost. Are we going to keep fighting, or is this like, are we about along, I think?

[Speaker 9]
So, can we have time?

[Speaker 3]
It's ten. It is 10

[Speaker 1]
P.m., um. Is up to you guys. You can choose to fight another monster if you wish, and if everyone has the time to do so, and the willingness to do so.

[Speaker 4]
I don't know

[Speaker 9]
About.

[Speaker 1]
You guys can keep on fighting without Zorro,

[Speaker 3]
Yeah?

[Speaker 1]
Um, if you want, I

[Speaker 3]
Just want to know what happens when we just have him use it every turn. Use the guns every turn, you know

[Speaker 9]
What? Why don't we roll, and if it goes longer than like 10 30s and 45, you guys go on without me

[Speaker 3]
Sure, and how, how someone else

[Speaker 9]
Can? I'll miss her in there, considering the fact that you guys have a

[Speaker 1]
Supercharged Rogue on your

[Speaker 4]
Game.

[Speaker 1]
Should be fine. Well, you guys could potentially kill a monster very quickly. Yeah, yeah.

[Speaker 4]
What are you guys fighting?

[Speaker 1]
The bezel G's,

[Speaker 9]
Yep,

[Speaker 4]
Do we have the pendant?

[Speaker 2]
Yes, we have. No,

[Speaker 1]
You do not have the pendants.

[Speaker 9]
Okay, so let's try it for two.

[Speaker 10]
I'm sorry, did we even fight them?

[Speaker 6]
Yeah, which

[Speaker 9]
Which we rolled for, but I was hoping for the the scale armor independent and? That means I forget that these two will get those two. Try to kill two. And if we can only kill one, we

[Speaker 4]
Get the armor all the time. We're gonna figure it out. But, yeah,

[Speaker 9]
Wait. Sounds good.

[Speaker 4]
Please, not four, I don't know. I

[Speaker 2]
Think we were on it.

[Speaker 9]
All right. Come on.

[Speaker 4]
I'm fine with two two. Is it four? It's four,

[Speaker 1]
It's four, and it's four, and it's four. It's four,

[Speaker 3]
Okay,

[Speaker 2]
Okay. Hold on. I think we just we just have to. I don't think we could take four.

[Speaker 9]
Yeah, sorry. Should we just learn them?

[Speaker 2]
Can we delve away from them as

[Speaker 1]
You guys can try to stealth if you want? I mean, it's you know? Possible for you guys to take one down. Really quick flee. Come back

[Speaker 4]
Okay. Well, I mean, it depends on where can we stealth check and then see. Can we decide? Do we

[Speaker 2]
Remember if they are immune to fire?

[Speaker 1]
Um,

[Speaker 2]
Yes,

[Speaker 1]
They, I believe they are resist either a resistant or immune, uh, and just as a reminder of what happens. Uh, what the, the Basics fighting style was. It's like this flying explosive bird that dropped scales all around the battlefield

[Speaker 4]
Continue to go.

[Speaker 4]
Is

[Speaker 3]
Insane. It

[Speaker 1]
Might be intense, I will say,

[Speaker 4]
Not just intense one, and one was you. Is this fire, though? Oh, is this fire, I was inspire.

[Speaker 2]
Now,

[Speaker 10]
I can fly

[Speaker 3]
If you put on the the vest you will responds, can raise or can ride. So just very clear. The resistance is on that are specifically from spells. Out

[Speaker 1]
For like these types of monsters,

[Speaker 4]
So our resistance is lowering count.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, now yours does because you're resistant to Firebase because yours is in general God. Damn, okay.

[Speaker 2]
Let's,

[Speaker 3]
Let's try. Let's try the plus one. Let's try to Blitz,

[Speaker 2]
I think, yeah, I'm sorry. Can you tell me if the resistance are humidifier is a big difference?

[Speaker 1]
There are mute. Okay, so

[Speaker 2]
They do these massive AOE explosions and none of them get hurt.

[Speaker 1]
That's great.

[Speaker 4]
Okay, never mind. Never mind, never mind fuck. I really want that if you want to do it

[Speaker 2]
Again. Can we try and stealth and then try and find a smaller amount of them.

[Speaker 6]
Why don't you guys just roll a stealth check?

[Speaker 6]
They're

[Speaker 2]
All than that one, and you're the one

[Speaker 5]
We need it. We're not gonna I

[Speaker 9]
Rolled the national 20.

[Speaker 10]
Oh,

[Speaker 5]
What success one failure zero? I wrote a 21 what success? No,

[Speaker 2]
No,

[Speaker 1]
No, no, the? The repassive perception is more than that. Uh,

[Speaker 2]
20 is a success.

[Speaker 9]
Well, natural twenty, then plus six was 26. Well, yeah, but

[Speaker 1]
He I'm just counting like as the three of you because he got a failure. Okay, it's best of three is what I'm saying. Uh, one failure. So, you're the deciding factor here.

[Speaker 1]
No,

[Speaker 2]
Okay. Anybody get to roll? I think that would help her change.

[Speaker 2]
Come on! How to drink baby? You got the hopeful music playing. Come on.

[Speaker 2]
The

[Speaker 1]
Subtitles will say music swelling at the moment. Yeah. Success! Of

[Speaker 3]
The team. Oh my gosh, okay, so you guys

[Speaker 1]
Have a surprise round if you want to try to just kill one as fast as possible. They have, uh, I will tell you how many hit points they each have 276 hit points. No, no, they have slightly more than a Ben Barrel

[Speaker 2]
56 and 43. No,

[Speaker 1]
The member had 243. These have 276.

[Speaker 2]
Seven's. Okay,

[Speaker 6]
Logan, more a little bit more. All right, let's do it. Let's do it.

[Speaker 3]
Let's do it all right.

[Speaker 3]
All

[Speaker 8]
Right, but totally depends how the DM positions them are. You're doing the same map. Oh yeah, this is the same. Remove this bag. Yep. You want to play into courts together. Lavender is indeed not here anymore. All right, any input? Robin, do you want an early surprise only silent?

[Speaker 8]
Not a bad idea.

[Speaker 2]
I mean, I'm a vote for. No, I didn't say that I, I don't think we should fight four of these. I'm okay

[Speaker 4]
To play as well. I mean, we can try.

[Speaker 3]
We can kill one. We can kill one. We can kill one. So, guys around, you can try

[Speaker 1]
Killing one on a surprise round. If it doesn't work, you flee. Yeah,

[Speaker 9]
Yeah, okay, let's do it. Let's do it. So

[Speaker 1]
Basically, this is a race to 276 points of damage exactly.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, if

[Speaker 4]
I print one, it's it's definitely. It's definitely doable. Yeah, I'm gonna that's.

[Speaker 6]
Little

[Speaker 3]
What? How much health is everyone? Are you okay,

[Speaker 2]
Uh, I'm not okay?

[Speaker 5]
I mean, if we fail to get us down in one run, we're I'm fucked anyway. By the way, these

[Speaker 1]
Technically can hunt you down. However, I will let you try because there's we don't have the time playing

[Speaker 2]
Today or do like a whole chasing scene. We absolutely do not have the time.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, so they're all gross up together.

[Speaker 9]
Uh, what? How did this fall Maybe

[Speaker 2]
Want to be spread out, wouldn't they? I think one would want to.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, surely they're not prepared on one side. Can they hurt each other? No, they can't. No, they're they're beautifier. The explosion of itself, harder. This is true. You have your immune to it. It's a very wishful thinking I. So, these are the four all right, bro. Back up.

[Speaker 1]
Back it up, back it up, back back up, back the fuck up, but me, and you, we need to go like right to the front.

[Speaker 3]
He'll have this guy. Yeah, we

[Speaker 8]
Go for that guy. A role for initiative on all four of them, so you know exactly how many friends you have before it's their turn. It's not great.

[Speaker 2]
Um, one of them rolled in actual point on their initiative.

[Speaker 1]
I don't know.

[Speaker 2]
I am the 21

[Speaker 6]
Initiative

[Speaker 2]
21

[Speaker 6]
Great. That is very important. Yes.

[Speaker 8]
I I fucked my initiative. I'm six, six. Oh

[Speaker 3]
My God,

[Speaker 2]
Nine nine. Like,

[Speaker 5]
Not the three,

[Speaker 2]
Four.

[Speaker 3]
Oh my God, guys. Initiative 18, 18. Is online.

[Speaker 2]
I'm dooming here. Yeah, okay, eight

[Speaker 1]
Eight. Okay, so everyone has one round except Hemlock quiz too okay, which is insanely important, and he only beats the next, uh, creature by one. So it was very close. Okay, so you guys effectively have, like one round of actions, plus another one from heblock 76 points.

[Speaker 3]
We have to go in order, or can you give them the organizers however you want. Okay, let me let me go first. I'll try a whole mouse. I'll go last right before him because I got the Battle Chiefs play.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, uh, grovel down. That's a whole monster on this one. Okay, holding monster. That's a wisdom save. It succeeds, right? What's your DC?

[Speaker 3]
Um, I'm using online bye what? What does it use? Is it wisdom wisdom 16? It succeeds.

[Speaker 1]
That's your turn. Unfortunately,

[Speaker 3]
That's so sad. Well, I just fuck it. It was cold or cold, maybe a better choice.

[Speaker 2]
I don't think I rolled above average on one of those d12s. Here, I hate dice. That's very sad. Do I have to do self check? Know your yourself. Okay. Hp at the starting now. Well, do I just go for it? Yeah, does anyone have anything they want to do before heblock takes us first shot?

[Speaker 2]
Um, I can go more advantage. You already have a better advantage. Go for it. Go for it. Go for it. Let's roll the day. Okay, the first one, natural one, but I have Advantage. Let's see what happens this time. This 13 hits. It's not, dude, what the fuck it does not hit.

[Speaker 5]
There's no way the rest of us gang. I think it might be cooked.

[Speaker 2]
Run. We need to run. I can't. If you want, I can give you another chance. I

[Speaker 8]
Should have hasted Hemlock.

[Speaker 2]
Oh fuck,

[Speaker 1]
I'll let you. I'll let you retroactively fix that if you want. Okay, oh my God.

[Speaker 4]
So

[Speaker 3]
I'll Hast hemlock. What does that mean? I get an extra action. Well, yeah, Howard. The thing is, these weapons are designed, so you, even if you just pull the trigger it's consumed.

[Speaker 1]
So, it wouldn't actually change much. It would be a regular attack. You can't switch to a new guy in the middle. That's correct. So it actually wouldn't change that much. Yeah, oh, okay, what's going on

[Speaker 2]
That is not too late to run?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, um, look at Robin. Yeah, oh, we, let's know, retconny. Let's just say, I failed my whole monster. It just keeps like drinking by the water, uh, it does not take effect you like charge you take. Aim there's like, slight Breeze. This, like, massive, really good, just like detonates.

[Speaker 1]
They all like turn their heads towards you and misses completely, and all of you guys look at each other and you're just fucking. You start running

[Speaker 3]
All right, man, no armor unfortunate?

[Speaker 3]
Know, I'm lucky. Well, only two people down there.

[Speaker 1]
Um, you guys continue traveling, uh, a little bit more. Draw them you? Come to a point. Okay, well, let me ask you one question, uh, above the table. Um, I talked with Fiona. She seemed kind of interested in playing D&D you. I'm giving you the choice of either rolling the die with normal dumb, you have a chance at restoring Phineas's memory at the cost at the risk of durable Dome losing his, in which case I won't let Fiona play double them okay, um.

[Speaker 1]
What's up, dude? Doorbellum can also just keep existing in this world. Uh, kill exists. As you know, an entity separate from the group, except you. If, even if if he fails and loses his memory, he'll still be an entity like in the world, right? He'll just have. He'll just be another memory zombie.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, there is a retirement hope of sorts.

[Speaker 3]
Will he just revert at like Phineas did back to like an infantile? Yes, exactly, um? I'll tell you what? It's gonna be a series of roles. Uh, of increasing difficulty. Uh. If you pass the majority of them. Uh, you restore his memory. Uh, but you lose your own if you get a natural 20.

[Speaker 1]
Along the way, you restoring his memory and yours is intact, or at least in its own. Uh, if you. Fail. Your memory is fucked, and so is his. If you roll a natural one, you die. Okay. Let's do it, Jesus. Okay, so. Let's, uh, set. We're set the scene.

[Speaker 1]
No, this is that's, that's just him. It's just him.

[Speaker 2]
How to the health act? Yeah,

[Speaker 3]
By like talking about the memories of Justin so, uh, set the scene for the for the long rest?

[Speaker 1]
I'll let you set the scene. How do you want to? How do you want to kind of conduct this all right? So,

[Speaker 3]
Let's say who originally here, where's where's kite? Where's kite in Phineas? Okay, Cindy. Here we'll

[Speaker 2]
Get a Phineas one.

[Speaker 3]
There's a little campfire little. That's yeah. Nice. Nice detail. We'll have height by the campfire.

[Speaker 4]
He's Canon that big actually. So, uh? Adorable

[Speaker 3]
Thumb as we are settling down for for the evening after our colossal failure. Of a hunt. Adorable Dome looks back on that thinks man. There's no other party. I would have liked to wake up every morning to and meet for the first time. I think every single time. He, uh, he thinks back to this morning.

[Speaker 3]
When he woke up and contrary to his previous diary entries rather than screaming in Terror. He was rather just intrigued at the kind and unpleasant faces of these new strangers. He, uh, looks fondly at the strange group at the. Guy who's got shit coming out of his ears? At the, uh, at the Dragonborn with this freaky third eye.

[Speaker 3]
At the half orc half to vaccine. Strange, strange. A mixture of creatures that, uh, that left him confused. As to how their parents. Did that? Uh, and also the, uh, the bird, the bird lady, who. Um, who was not as strange looking as the rest, but nonetheless, he. He, uh, eggs birds are quite strange, looking to begin with so.

[Speaker 3]
You know? Anthropomorphic burdens even is even stranger than that. He feels that, somewhere, deep down inside, he's gone to know his Newfound comrades, and um. He doesn't consciously remember them. Every morning, a part of him. Still does from each day. A bit of memory is ingrained into his heart.

[Speaker 3]
And he trusts him with his life, despite making them strangers. He takes one look. Over the river. The moonlit ripples. Moving across the surface. As he reflects. On the operation is about to, he's about to. Perform on Phineas. He himself knows the risks. He's kept it somewhat hidden from height

[Speaker 2]
Because he didn't. He doesn't want anyone to worry.

[Speaker 3]
And uh, at the same time, feels that at his old age, and with all the things he's been through and. His memory being a mistake that it already is. It's a small sacrifice. If it comes wrong. Walks over with the pep in his step, feeling good about what he's about to do, confident that no matter the outcome, they'll be happy with his efforts.

[Speaker 3]
What's the? Looks at Phineas. Looks back okay, and that's, uh, so. Are you ready? Are you ready at first? You're the one doing

[Speaker 2]
Everything here. I'm always ready. What are you talking about? What do you think I've spent so many decades studying, for that matter. This is all I remember. Well, without further Ado.

[Speaker 8]
Uh, normal Dome reaches into a sack, and uh.

[Speaker 3]
Out the remainder of his Supply. And uh, he sort of pours. Of the length of his arm. Just just be careful for that. Yeah, he, you know, where's the lasellos powder out the length of his arm? A bit of a shake in his hand, but as he just. Up from his from his, uh, shoulder to his wrist.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah. And then, finally. His breathing is slow and steady, and his hands are calm. He walks behind Phineas. Sort of holds us, his eyes and and puts his hands over Phineas's head. And begins casting the experimental magic. That has, until now, just been. Of figment of his imagination. Rather than anything with.

[Speaker 3]
An experimental. Proof of its uh of its success? Of its viability.

[Speaker 9]
As all of you guys, are you doing this in the denim night when no one where no one is watching, or are you doing this with everyone in view, uh, he Global dumb is just doing this with Heidi Vegas. Okay, yeah, you guys are apart, um? Billy, the swabelly is, uh, kind of like skimpering around and goes on top of your head as you're casting the spell.

[Speaker 1]
You start entering fenice's mind, and as you saw before, you feel this kind of presence of someone who's been forced back into, like a corner of their mind. Repressed memories from their childhood. And their adulthood, the same as like a kind of very tight package somewhere in the corner of the brain.

[Speaker 1]
Crystal is just the DC-10. Arcana. Is the roll Arcana Arcana? Let me see what you're good at.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, you passed the first roll. As

[Speaker 1]
You start kind of?

[Speaker 2]
You

[Speaker 1]
Start, uh, diving deeper into his mind and trying to play with his memories and trying to figure out what is happening with these memories. How are they compacted into such a tight form as you're doing so you can kind of feel? Um, your recent memories meld with finneases. You see finneus's memories climbing up Fool's gold, uh, him and his party encountering.

[Speaker 1]
Uh, most of them almost dying. You see the final moments of Phineas's mind as he Fades into darkness, and he sees that light. You feel it yourself as well. Until he sees berman and that he is born again. Do you also remember some of your own memories as you're doing so?

[Speaker 1]
You feel like you're unlocking a certain part of your own brain. As you're doing this, figuring out how your own brain has erased your own memory and how it's fucked up. You remember times in your life where you were young. You were spry, you still abused multiple substances. At the same time, you always partied hard.

[Speaker 1]
For now, those are the memories that you're getting. Um, you feel like you're delving deeper into his mind. Dc15.

[Speaker 3]
Is this also Arcana? Yes, okay, so that's, uh, it's a 23 pass. No problem.

[Speaker 1]
You keep delving deeper into his memories, and you see memories of Phineas, younger, and younger, uh, you see, the memory that, uh, kite was talking about, specifically, where she talks about. A moment where Phineas was in danger, you feel the fear that he fears in that moment. Faced with this enormous Beast, which now you've slain hundreds of times, but yet, when you're living through his memory, you feel that same fear.

[Speaker 1]
You see, a younger kite come to the rescue of her baby brother, um, and you feel admiration and respect for this person who you only kind in you. You see even more younger memories of yourself? You see, one particular memory of yourself studying, becoming the scholar that you are.

[Speaker 1]
You remember getting? All of the awards, the resources, the research that you wanted, but you also remember the substance that at one point was fun. Eventually became something that was paralyzing you. Um.

[Speaker 1]
Three girl dc20, oh boy.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, 18, 18. It's a failure. You have more chances. It's the best of five. Okay, so you'll roll another D20. Okay. And if you succeed, you succeed. Um, however, your mind isn't going to leave intact since you failed one. Okay, unless you get a natural party.

[Speaker 1]
14,

[Speaker 10]
14. One last roll, one last roll, all right guys.

[Speaker 3]
This

[Speaker 8]
One's for all the Coke, this one's wrong.

[Speaker 8]
Catching up to me.

[Speaker 3]
Oh, that's 18 again. You haven't experience it. You have inspiration. You haven't used it. Okay, and that's all because you guessed the word.

[Speaker 1]
Yes. Okay.

[Speaker 2]
As, uh, you mentioned, doubledown has got some of his memories back. Let's say that part of those is. Finally, he remembers. The. Month or something. He's been traveling with everybody.

[Speaker 2]
At last, he finally remembers. Who everyone is in the entirety of his experience with them. Remembers. Uh, having a drink with boar at the bar. Having a jovial time with his girlfriend? You remember to see the painting of having lost someone you just met and just started to get to know?

[Speaker 1]
Your members.

[Speaker 2]
Remembers, uh, hemlock's seriousness. As, uh, and and his obsessive. Quest for knowledge. He thinks about Cyril's struggles to find meaning in his.

[Speaker 3]
In his relationship with his God, he's somewhat unconsensual relationship with God.

[Speaker 1]
And.

[Speaker 3]
He thinks about makes kindness and. And as far as animals, and uh. He smiles like he was able to remember everyone for one last time, so you have a plus 12, right? Yes, so you need to roll an H or higher.

[Speaker 6]
Oh, oh my God.

[Speaker 2]
That's 35.

[Speaker 1]
As your mind starts to delve even deeper, you feel your memories start to meld with finneases. And for a second, you almost fear that you are going to, like, almost become a single person.

[Speaker 2]
Uh-Oh, as you? Have that moment of, like, oh fuck, this is going wrong.

[Speaker 1]
You compose yourself, you're a scholar. You've got this. You've done just a shit ton of LaSalles before this. Um. You think to yourself? I would rather be the ship that goes down out of the two. You want to save Phineas more than you want to save yourself and you're willing to rip away your own memories from finneases so that he can survive with his memory.

[Speaker 1]
Feel Phineas as a person. Start to unfold, and all of his memories flash before you one by one faster and faster. You feel them all in, like a very strong emotion. A like, a chain reaction of emotion that becomes very overwhelming to you.

[Speaker 1]
And then it just kind of stops. There is a piece that comes to your mind. You can hear the Crickets. You can hear Billy on the top of your forehead, snoring. You can feel the world around you for just a few extra seconds.

[Speaker 1]
More memories come back to you as you ground yourself. You see yourself experimenting in your lab? With something that adorable dumb has not done since he lost his memory, which is test subjects. Um. And you remember a point? An experiment gone wrong, where your test subject? Was devastated. An old lady who you had particular affections for?

[Speaker 1]
Go under your own experimentation and die at your own hand.

[Speaker 3]
You remember drowning in a sea of substance and sorrow?

[Speaker 1]
And promising yourself to never experiment again on anyone but yourself.

[Speaker 1]
What is durable? Dubs last thoughts or words before he loses his mind completely.

[Speaker 1]
Adorable Dome!

[Speaker 2]
Feeling Phineas's personality, unravel and take. Its full and complete shape. Um, as dribbledums. Own sense of self starts to fade, uh, he's still able to recognize that. The job was a success. And so. He matters. Some kind of underneath his breath. Uh, both to himself and to kite. Thank goodness it worked before.

[Speaker 2]
Promptly losing Consciousness. Falling over. Um, you see, adorable dumb.

[Speaker 1]
Uh, fall over. Are those your last words? Thank goodness, um? As you lose Consciousness that? Tunnel of light that you saw within. Phineas's vision comes to you as well, and there's like a moment of Darkness. And then you become a new person. Um, you're born again.

[Speaker 1]
You have completely lost your mind. You are no longer adorable them.

[Speaker 3]
Both of them immediately begins crying like a baby, and it's his cat.

[Speaker 2]
Well, he's a baby now, right? I don't think this is the first time Dora would understand that on us to be honest. Yeah, well, aging is almost like, is also like regressing it.

[Speaker 9]
Shoots himself and squeezes off around them.

[Speaker 2]
Guys, it was so good for like five minutes. That's global, though, man.

[Speaker 2]
So, what's? So, what's kite's reaction to seeing, uh, Donald Trump, succeed? Say thank you Phineas before. Like she even notices anything new with Phineas. She sees doorbellum start to pass out, and she steps jumps over the fire to like catch him as he's falling and be like, what do you mean it works?

[Speaker 2]
This doesn't seem like it's working adorable. Dumb, are you still there doorbell's home?

[Speaker 3]
Gobledon, and he's like sucking his thumb in a foul smash.

[Speaker 2]
You know what dumbled up dies?

[Speaker 6]
Uh, no, I'm just kidding.

[Speaker 6]
Horrible, um? Don't put them die as he lives.

[Speaker 2]
A high on drugs and shedding his pants, and I'm forgetting about it, um.

[Speaker 1]
As adorable Dome collapses, and you go to see him, like, try to see what's wrong with him. A peaceful Phineas who was just sleeping. Uh, suddenly, kind of like plucks his hands up. He rises, he looks around, he looks straight at you, and he goes kite.

[Speaker 4]
Kate turns around, and it's like. Phineas, she she jumps back.

[Speaker 2]
Give some a big bear hug. He just immediately goes in immediately. Just starts crying. She's usually not a very physical person. Um, but in this moment, she can't can't hold herself back in his ass to, like, they're. Giant yes,

[Speaker 1]
Yeah,

[Speaker 9]
Yeah, giant bear, hugging, oh, he cries in your hands immediately.

[Speaker 5]
Are you really back? What happened. I was.

[Speaker 1]
What I was so confused, who? Who are these people don't worry about that right now? All that matters is, I'm your back.

[Speaker 2]
Kites, and uh, he goes for another hug, um.

[Speaker 1]
King keeps crying for a while, and he just kind of like holds you tight for a very, very long time. Before. Eventually, you guys, kind of like, break the hug. Um, and he goes. I am so confused right now, I. Was I like, uh, like mentally?

[Speaker 7]
Like gone for a while, was it like in a coma?

[Speaker 1]
What happened? I

[Speaker 2]
Mean, you've always been, you know, I mean, you've always been much more at these magic, fancy sort of stuff guys, so it's going over my head, but I think somebody took over your body and when they left. You weren't able to come back. But then. And then she looks over.

[Speaker 2]
It's adorable job and. Feels. Feels so wrong to have been so happy in this moment. When dormbledon just? Sacrifice. Himself like that, and now she feels such a. She's doesn't know how to. Mash those two emotions see and? Sadness that she feels that losing adorable dumb, but also be thankfulness and.

[Speaker 2]
Something that she was worried would never happen again getting. To speak to her baby

[Speaker 3]
Brother once more. As he as he always has been.

[Speaker 2]
So she, she looks so good to adorable down

[Speaker 6]
And said.

[Speaker 2]
A great man sacrificed a lot. To bring you back. So I can't. I can't help but envisioning you saying that, as he's sucking.

[Speaker 3]
Would rather laugh than cry. He, he would have, yeah. He would have loved the idea that he's in fetal position. He's plugging his thumb, his pants as kite is struggling to process, just lost evores and and kite remembers that the dwarf gun was always someone who would prefer it to look

[Speaker 2]
At the bright side of things, so she tries to.

[Speaker 2]
This. Confusing moment to focus on what she now has and not what she has lost. Wait a minute. What about my party? Are they?

[Speaker 10]
What the fuck happened to us all that, right? No, they, they said, yeah, oh no, all the.

[Speaker 1]
Um, yeah, I, they didn't think. He just starts crying again. It's a lot of emotions overcoming him at once. There's a grief in his eyes that. Um. He, you know, his companions and his compatriots, while not his family, are still very important to him, uh. But he also feels this, like, immense joy and happiness at seeing you again.

[Speaker 1]
And feeling his own body again and his own personality like inhabit his own body. Um, as opposed to, you know, who knows, uh? There's a moment where he kind of like looks towards the rest of your party, he goes so. Is this? He got me out of that state.

[Speaker 1]
Yes. What's wrong with him, the greatest? Memory Wizard and? On all of those era.

[Speaker 1]
Seems like. Saved you, but in doing so, can I? Can I do you think I can take a look inside? His head and? You won't, you will know better than me. Um. Phineas goes over to you. As you are losing your minds? I'll let you roll one last D20.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, um? Dc 25. Uh, Arcana. Again, if you pass, you can, as you are losing your mind, pass the information that you gained as insight to his mind so that Phineas can try and continue your research into memory Magic. Perhaps find a permanent solution to this. Damn, please. So, they're supposed to have been so bad 13 or higher.

[Speaker 1]
Oh yeah, this pressure is high.

[Speaker 3]
Money.

[Speaker 3]
He has a path, uh, a much tougher path, uh, especially decoding your notes. Who are, I'm sure, extremely cryptic and hard to read? Yeah. But baby Phoenix will succeed eventually, regardless. And that's gonna be it for tonight. Oh man. That was so fun. And at the end. Holy shit.

[Speaker 3]
Thank you.

[Speaker 2]
And for the pizzas. Thank you,

[Speaker 1]
Thank

[Speaker 2]
You, thank you. You guys rehearsed this. No, no, extremely like. That was, like, YouTube level.

[Speaker 10]
I'm so I'm so happy with how he went. That's

[Speaker 2]
Awesome, he's he has a nap for ending characters and a really good note. My last character ended spectacularly as well, so does work. Yeah.

[Speaker 8]
Yeah, I, I had. I definitely had,

[Speaker 1]
Like, a whole thing planned from your character, so I definitely had to be cut a little bit short. I

[Speaker 3]
Also had, like, if I just didn't have a didn't have enough

[Speaker 1]
Fucking job man, stay out of plane, right? Like, just playing?

[Speaker 3]
That's gonna be the last time we see you for a long time, too. Yeah, yeah, the next time I'll be back is.

[Speaker 3]
Probably, it's just that I need. I need to know if I'm okay to need. It's like acceptable for me to take my vacation. Okay, I forgot how the PTO days were working so well, it's not. It's not bad, uh, nobody takes taking your days. Oh, so I don't want to be the only guy baby.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, yeah, no, no, it's not really good luck. Now, come visit you in Taiwan! How long's here, how long's your?

[Speaker 2]
Three years.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah,

[Speaker 1]
I'll I'll be. I'll see you. I'll see you soon that. That'd be so cool. Did D kudos to Taiwan, but if I don't know Chinese New Year, I'll probably come back. Maybe Christmas?

[Speaker 3]
And we'll be here every day and then. And oh, I'd love to drop into one of your sessions to just be like a guest characteristics N would be. You can stay in the Discord, you know. She put the date if you want. Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
Man, it's so. It's so sad because having DND, like every week, every couple weeks, have been so fun. Yeah, I'm sorry. I miss it so much. Yeah, a little bit of his normal, though normal dog was great.

[Speaker 3]
I'm lavender fuck that guy. Trying to get overshadowed? We put them in the dirt at Disney with, like twice about it.

[Speaker 2]
He was definitely. You guys are significantly weaker Now, by the way. Is he combat ready?

[Speaker 1]
I'll leave that up to you guys inside

[Speaker 10]
You, guys.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, you guys will need Phineas to charge up.

[Speaker 1]
Who knows, maybe Fiona will play videos. Man, I can't see her playing Dungeons of Drake. She does not have the patience for this. Yeah, I think she would, uh.

[Speaker 2]
We were, we were looking. We were looking at ants today, and she was like they're bringing the crumbs too slow. And then she started like pushing them with a leap to go faster. Yeah, I know, that sounds like a fun person. She would probably lose her Vibe in combat.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, yeah. I'm barely holding on in combat at this point so much. Yeah, yeah, we need to kill off some characters. So, hey, well, now you're too down. We need to roll less dice.

[Speaker 1]
Was damage guys?

[Speaker 2]
Well, our conclusion is that we're good at killing character, so he we should let him kill more characters.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah,

[Speaker 2]
Does anyone see who ride with us? Whose phone is this? So let's start this one. Does anyone need a ride West?

[Speaker 2]
I can change up,

[Speaker 1]
Uh, the really good weapon. Make it faster to use that, I guess. Now, if I only thought, but I might be might make combat boring, if on anyone's ever doing history.

[Speaker 2]
It was the only combat it just gets like that. I mean, separate level, like, I mean, yeah, at this point. Like, you guys just have so much things in your kits.

[Speaker 7]
Even besides, like

[Speaker 1]
All the Homebrew stuff that I do give you,

[Speaker 7]
I

[Speaker 1]
Like giving you Humper stuff. I mean

[Speaker 2]
Heights kind of killing it. I think I don't think Kai's ever done anything twice the same,

[Speaker 1]
Like same thing twice in a row. I'll come with always in my journality was just a pack. No,

[Speaker 2]
It's like utility, and you're like you like reaction bonus actions, fucking ancestors.

[Speaker 1]
Do you have any comment? Just guess, like that, right? At level 11. That's why we're not going past like level 13, that's just yeah, um.

[Speaker 9]
Is just the way it is right. Like, obviously, when we're going to best Spirit, there's a lot more, or like, not that we're gonna even make it at far, but it's like when you care about that person, you're then focusing a lot more on every single person's round because you're like, I just want this person to die.

[Speaker 9]
Yeah, of course.

[Speaker 1]
Like

[Speaker 9]
With a guy you're like, well, we'll probably get a few more rounds and who is he joining us? Oh, it

[Speaker 2]
Was so fun, man. Keep in touch, let's come inside. Hey, good to see you again. Oh, bye, bye. Oh, if, uh?

[Speaker 2]
Olivia and Taipei for like, a week before I moved to Shinju for. Yeah, and you'll, you'll have to go to Taipei for fun. Anyway, at least a couple of times, um, I know you've got the other business, but yeah. Too fast. I can't believe it's already. Wednesday, yeah. Sucks, but it'll also go through facts, you know, three years.

[Speaker 2]
Blink your eyes. That's scary though, cuz I'm, what do you mean black Twenty eight years old?

[Speaker 1]
Congress wait, you'll be 29. No, no, I'm not. 28 yeah, no, no. But when he comes back, I'll

Be 29,

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, I'm 20, I'm 27 right now. Yeah, he'll be thirty. Five.

[Speaker 8]
Yeah, I

[Speaker 1]
Thought it was, like, oh guys, were you getting home?

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, wait, how are you

[Speaker 1]
Seven two thousand eight

[Speaker 2]
Thousand eight Wednesday? I

[Speaker 3]
Guess my God, why are we sold? I don't know, there's frogs, we're getting there, I think, who's the Taekwondo Club? Yeah, I wish you the smoothest move ever, I know. Sorry, I have to move, like? I have to move, like? Once, twice,

[Speaker 1]
Three times at least. Moving and moving can be a pain. Yeah, it will be a pain, but you know what? Goes professionals backing you up? Yeah, it's true, like, oops.

[Speaker 3]
Clear what they're gonna if they help me move in the second time or the third time here, too. But oh, my gosh, probably through them. No.

[Speaker 3]
Y'all. Thank you for having me for DND, though. It's been really fun playing with you. Guys has been awesome. We're just gonna be DM. Happy for the invite man,

[Speaker 4]
I know. I wish we had known about you earlier and invited you even earlier. That was good cell phone, but it's been great. Yeah,

[Speaker 1]
You had like a pretty. It must be a day group that fell apart, right? We

[Speaker 3]
Had a, it was okay. It wasn't like, it wasn't as good as a screw. Was, I learned, yet you were a better DM.

[Speaker 1]
You're a better DM because I, your storytelling's great characters are great because the voices are great.

[Speaker 9]
The green Igor's range is huge.

[Speaker 2]
You guys are way too nice. No,

[Speaker 9]
It's true.

[Speaker 1]
So every time I play a character, I feel so stupid.

[Speaker 9]
I really,

[Speaker 1]
I just want you guys to know that I'm quite strong.

[Speaker 3]
It's always so good,

[Speaker 1]
But

[Speaker 3]
And you commit. So, yeah, yeah, it

[Speaker 1]
Makes the sessions.

[Speaker 3]
Oh yeah, it really does. But, and

[Speaker 1]
Hope to separate the characters like a utility center boy, like I. Because sometimes I do like legitimately forget what a character sounds like,

[Speaker 3]
Oh

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, do they Widow? He was, um, when it wasn't a woman's body, and he was talking as a British man, which I thought was really.

[Speaker 3]
That's true. She

[Speaker 1]
Had the same voice as before, I cannot convincingly do women's voices very well. I try to like, just like, Elevate the a pitch a little bit and just make them slightly breathier.

[Speaker 1]
Was, even though I was like, it's so confusing that he's an old woman's body. Now,

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, I was kind of thinking, like, what's going on here, you know?

[Speaker 3]
I think it totally makes sense, but Uno just still sells the same. No matter what happens facts, in fact,

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, he

[Speaker 3]
Could be in there. He

[Speaker 1]
Gets body dysmorphia on his new body so that he's got like cartoon roles right? When they do body swap, they escape the exactly. Yeah, it was the same voice actor.

[Speaker 1]
I can't believe it. I don't want to. I don't want to leave.

[Speaker 3]
What's the time difference in I want? You know, it's 16 hours and way away. Yeah, so it'll be like.

[Speaker 2]
After Sonic,

[Speaker 1]
If I do any games over Discord, yeah, I was gonna say, open, like one. Well,

[Speaker 2]
I'll if, if, like, let's say in in two, three years. I come back. I'm definitely joining whatever solar punk thing you've gone going on. And like, 100 percent, I will probably have run that at that point. I mean, you know, I

[Speaker 1]
Can run it again.

[Speaker 2]
This one took how many years. Yeah, learn two and us, so this one takes like another six months and then.

[Speaker 2]
About the same part of yeah.

[Speaker 3]
Part of the story. Yeah, that's true. I'm hoping that this campaign will be over by the start of the next Academic Year.

[Speaker 3]
I said that already, like six months ago, so?

[Speaker 1]
Um, but I will try. This is, this is the last Arc. This, is it? Okay. Man, make, make good use of my corpse. I'm talking.

[Speaker 2]
We haven't retirement home, even.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, it's, it's his character, I think,

[Speaker 2]
Like the Canyon and your body. Yeah, it was really thrilled. You're like a five year old, and you're in like a 100 year old's body. I mean, like, yes,

[Speaker 1]
Yes. I'm totally like, I'll kill, like putting that on. You guys like, like, so, what are you guys doing with this guy like sacrifices his mind?

[Speaker 1]
Just take him to Carver and whatever

[Speaker 9]
And what she says a babysit, like a,

[Speaker 1]
And we saved her life. You want to live, we save her life.

[Speaker 2]
I'm sure they'd adopt you as their son. I think

[Speaker 1]
It's highly. It's not like it's a lifelong Sports. She's going to die, and he's forty five years or whatever eighty year. So, yeah, oh yeah, I'm sorry. She's taking care of my brother. That's crazy for me to be, like Harrison H.

[Speaker 3]
This child is a child. Now, are you going to let him live this awful life in this old man's body until he dies in five years of old age. We're getting into Eugenics now. Basically, yeah. This

[Speaker 1]
Is effectively five

[Speaker 2]
Years, has been very

[Speaker 3]
Medically, assist with suicide, but for, like, a zero year old.

[Speaker 2]
I do not think as Ariel can consent to something like that, right?

[Speaker 1]
This is basically a ninth

[Speaker 7]
Month abortion. That's it.

[Speaker 2]
80 year old people.

[Speaker 4]
I mean, it's more like just dementia,

[Speaker 3]
But yeah, I imagine there's like moments of lucidity. True, this is even worse than it is. Actually, that's true.

[Speaker 1]
Sorry, guys! It's because your problem's like, an interesting, you know, things. I just want to talk to you. That's, that's good. Let the party. Figure it out these these, their problems. I don't even figure it out for you right now. And when you said, yeah, Ramadan just dies. I could not.

[Speaker 1]
I was trying so hard to not laugh. I kept thinking back to it. And it's like, yeah, no, we'll just die. I did that. I, I was signal. If your roles a natural one, what's the worst case scenario? It just fucking dies, I think we stole. It would have been so funny if you just fucking died.

[Speaker 1]
Maybe just. It was like the strain come seeing the mission shed his pants and then die. It was hard to stop. Yeah.

[Speaker 3]
Robotoe has to have.

[Speaker 1]
I, I'm terrified by the fact, but that, uh, you were, like, yeah, he shuts his pants. But, you know, it's good, it's realistic. He, he, you know

[Speaker 4]
Now, he died. Yeah,

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, when you

[Speaker 1]
Die, you shut your pants when you're born. You shake your pants. Yeah, exactly. Oh my God.

[Speaker 1]
Route, she'll be like, yes.

[Speaker 3]
You guys are probably never going to cover Taiwan, but if you do hit me up, yeah, of course, and I'll hit you guys out. When I come back to visit optimistically, I'll be back once a year. How long do you think that's going to be like a week, a week?

[Speaker 3]
Well, this Chinese New Year when's that trying to February, February, yeah.

[Speaker 3]
Um, yeah, well, that's a big daddy, I see.

[Speaker 1]
I'll let you play as another thing that evil guy, oh my, you know what, you know, what? I, uh. Thought there was like this interesting thing that I read, yeah, where you delegate your big bag evil guys to other people. Have you watched that video as well. Yeah, do you want to play as a big, bad evil guy?

[Speaker 3]
Yes, that would be so awesome, right, fantastic.

[Speaker 1]
So, obviously, you won't expect to play them in game, but I'll give you like what their objectives are. Oh, and what they can do. Oh my, you can just like, think as a big bad people again, like, try to plan their moves. Yeah, that's awesome.

[Speaker 4]
That's so fun. I

[Speaker 3]
Love to do that. I, I don't know, that's going to be. I'm gonna be going to be Norm music.

[Speaker 4]
Oh

[Speaker 3]
Great, I'm going. He's gonna be a real thorn in. You guys don't say that when you're going through the immigration project. Yeah, now that I'm here, I can be the best terrorist in the world.

[Speaker 3]
When I'm in Taiwan, I'll be behind. It'll be so good. They're like, show me recordings of me and my apartment talking to my computer, like right. So this terrorist sounds gonna go a lot of that. And then I die and shit my pants.

[Speaker 1]
The calling card of our our terrorists is that they should their parents are the best

[Speaker 3]
Relax. That'll change instead of the Sinai pill, it's just an accident.

[Speaker 2]
They shit themselves to die. That's how they kill them. Okay, okay. Before I'm staying the prisoner because they don't want to.

[Speaker 1]
Oh God, yeah, but it's, uh, you'll. You'll also get all the conflicts for the the yo. Awesome, you'll get to know all the secrets. That's cool.

[Speaker 3]
Crazy no, no, no, no, you? You gotta get the secret. Now, that's how that's me. I got it cool.

[Speaker 3]
Gonna Miss it too, man.

[Speaker 1]
Are you driving home or not, um?

[Speaker 8]
I've been so tired this whole time.

[Speaker 3]
Thank you so much for playing with us. Yeah, you do this entirely for fun. I mean, it's not just purely for the love of the game. I look forward to it every week.

[Speaker 1]
Well, now it's like a little. We'll sign up away from today, so I gotta I'm like. I'm like directing his, uh, objectives. Yes, yes, I'll give you like what he wants to do. Yeah, what he can and can't do, and like their organization and stuff, because I uh, need help.

[Speaker 1]
I am like a lot of like, like, these things. Yeah, especially now that I have to go to school and stuff. Oh yeah, um.

[Speaker 1]
That's so true. I, it's a great idea. I don't think Michelle has the balls to be my big, valuable guy. Yeah.

[Speaker 2]
It's like a trapped artifice or who's, like, really nice, and father and your girlfriend is, oh yeah, they're gay. Yeah.

[Speaker 3]
Hopefully, I'll see you soon. Bye, you, guys. Yeah, the next time the next time.

[Speaker 2]
All right guys have a good night! I'm safe, bye!

[Speaker 2]
You okay? Oh, super fun! I'm super hungry too.

[Speaker 2]
I gotta go to sleep. Good night! Good night! That was exhausting.

[Speaker 1]
Okay.

[Speaker 2]
I'll grow back. I just need to be.

[Speaker 2]
Sorry you, Michelle. You good?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
You're so insanely creative and talented. No, that's so sweet of you. Thank you. I really don't feel that way, but you're so validated. Why? I just think. It's really like creative.

[Speaker 1]
Let's practice. I've never been playing these games.

[Speaker 1]
Can you imagine the amount of hours I have, not only I played this game, but thinking about this game time, this game reading this game? Yeah, but even like I find people that, you know? Watch the content. I wouldn't go to the same thing when you do incredible at it.

[Speaker 2]
Like the way that, like, you know, watching YouTube videos and the other stuff, but really like watching play today, made me appreciate being the lovely.

[Speaker 2]
The ones ever said. Do you think this would be more?

[Speaker 2]
So I can see it again.

[Speaker 2]
I just want to hear the thoughts.

[Speaker 2]
The combat was a little long. I kind of stood something happened, and I got really sleepy, and I was like, wow. Combats are really long. Yeah, but the storyline and like, you acting as different characters, and I, I know, like the people on, like YouTube, and stuff does too, but it's so funny, and it's like an emotional saying you're like, I cried.

[Speaker 2]
And that's like.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, and I can't act that out. I can't make myself cry and and all these things. I'm really not going to eat like a. I genuinely don't think I'm a very good actor, like it's very hard for me to like. Act. I think that's like the defense of like role playing acting.

[Speaker 2]
I feel like I'm okay with knowing what a character would do, but I can't act it for shit, you know? So, and that's okay. So it's a role-playing game. It's not active. I'm not going to play for an audience.

[Speaker 2]
I think the way that.

[Speaker 2]
I think, even if it is tiring for something cold. I think, especially the really long combat, and it's not as interesting. Like, I think it's so clear. In their work. Just how, like, passionate, you are, and how much you care and? Yeah, I feel like, it's like healing with your creativity and effort.

[Speaker 2]
All right, that's great. I had a great time watching.

[Speaker 2]
I mean, it's also like. We'll say Daniel and Geraldine is great to play with. Yeah, because he's very like. I think he he understands, like, what makes his character his character? And he doesn't shy away from like being silly here, like being true. I think it was great describe to me, so I think he'll be a great deal too.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, I agree with you. The car is long this long. It's really like this one. I was, like so.

[Speaker 1]
My head started giving them bubbles. Like level eight for a long time. Because the more should they get the more like veterans Day, it's just like it's. Level four. Like people die, and everyone's going very simple stuff, and my gosh, really faster. I know about that, like when everyone away from another character, like, relatively okay, or it's not like the pros, you know, um?

[Speaker 1]
So, a lot of the times, it's like. What can my character do again? Like, what's this thing again? It just takes one. It doesn't help the fact that it gives them like a lot of, um.
