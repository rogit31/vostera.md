Layla, the Nightmaiden is the goddess of the night, of the hunt, the woods, of animals, of introspection and peace.

## Lua and Layla
---

As [[Lua]]'s sister, they fight for their time in the sky during their [[Sola|mother]]'s absence, creating the cycles of the moon.

## Representation
---

Layla is one of the more enigmatic deities of the Vosteran pantheon. In iconography she is often represented as a massive serpent with scales as dark as the night sky, or as a tall woman of olive skin carrying bow and arrow wearing a black mask.

Layla's cult is small but dedicated, consisting mostly of hunters, thieves, and druids. Her followers believe in self-reliance, independence, and the importance of solitude and introspection in order to connect with nature and the divine. They see the forest as a place of mystery and magic, where Layla's presence is strongest.

## Philosophy
---

Layla's philosophy is one of balance, harmony, and respect for nature. She teaches that everything in the world is connected, and that every action has a consequence. Her followers strive to live in harmony with the natural world, using its resources wisely and only taking what they need. This puts her at odd with [[Lua]]'s philosophy of cyclicism, where everything that rises must eventually fall and vice versa. In Layla's cult, death is a finality with no potential of reincarnation. Instead, it is the natural order of things or the law of the hunt, which is that every hunt  must end eventually, regardless of outcome. 

In agreement to her sister however, both life and death hold a sacred space in both of their cults. 

Both these things put Layla's philosophies greatly at odds with [[Kaira]]'s however, who takes a much more communal, casual approach to both the meaning of life and death.
