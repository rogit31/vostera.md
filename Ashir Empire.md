The Ashir empire is an empire birthed in 431 AP that extends and controls both continents of [[Eloran]] and [[Imar]]. It is a dynastic empire originally controlled by [[The Ashirs]], a family said to be the descendants of [[The Planewalker]]. After [[Phoenixgate]], [[The Hudals]] took over the senate and the [[Hudalists]] became the majority government of the empire. It has recently been overtaken by the [[Vesperians]]. The current ruling emperor of the empire is [[Thomas Hudal]]. The current consul of the empire is [[Vespera Argent]].

## History
---
The first human settlements were in the Ashir valley, where [[the Planewalker]] supposedly led the first humans to agriculture, government and policy, inspired by [[Sola]]'s light. When [[the Planewalker ]]died, her firstborn child, [[Nola Ashir]] inherited the position of power she was in. She had also inherited part of her mother's powers, but to some extent wasn't as close to [[Sola | The Sunmother]]'s light as her mother was. This kicked off the most dominant political force in [[Vostera]], what is known today as the Ashir Empire. 

### [[Avendor]], the first settlement
#### Nola Ashir
According to legend, [[Avendor]] became the first humanoid settlement on [[Vostera]], counting at first a measly 30 or so inhabitants. During [[The Planewalker]]'s life, the small settlement continued to grow to around 800 inhabitants at the time of her death in 128 AP. Little is known about these early times, but some families have their names originating from these primordial times in the Empire's history, notably [[The Hudals]], the [[Argent Family]], and of course [[The Ashirs]]. After [[The Planewalker]]'s death, [[Nola Ashir|Nola]] slowly expanded the territory of [[Avendor]] and the population of [[Avendor]] boomed. At [[Nola Ashir|Nola]]'s death in 180 AP, [[Avendor]] counted about 3000 inhabitants and had grown into a small town. Two years before her death, [[Nola Ashir]] also created the [[Academy Arcanum]] as a police force related to aether.
#### Kael Ashir
[[Kael Ashir]], [[Nola Ashir|Nola]]'s firstborn son, succeeded Nola's position as unofficial ruler of [[Avendor]]. He made the position official as [[Avendor]]'s first mayor, and it is said he was a strict albeit intelligent ruler. Under his rule, it is rumored some of [[Avendor]]'s citizens left the town to explore the rest of [[Vostera]]. Nevertheless, under his rule, the town expanded even more, and by his death in 303 AP, [[Avendor]] had grown to a population of approximately 10 000 inhabitants. 
### Ashirian Expansion
After [[Kael Ashir|Kael]]'s death, his firstborn son [[Leander Ashir]] took over as mayor of [[Avendor]]. By this point in time, [[Avendor]] was no longer the only settlement in the [[Ashir Valley]], and some tensions had started to rise in between settlements competing for natural resources and with different political and ideological stances. [[Leander Ashir|Leander]] took an aggressive expansionist stance after his father's death and expanded [[Avendor]]'s territory with brute force, using his spellweaving powers to slaughter anyone facing him and his allies, often intimidating any opponents into surrender much before a full blown conflict started. [[Avendor]] quickly became a city-state, with the Ashirs overseeing all of it. Eventually realizing that the Ashirs by themselves could not rule the quickly expanding city, [[Leander Ashir|Leander]] created a senate lead by a consul in order to make policies in their stead while they ruled and conquered the neighboring regions. Five years after the formation of the [[Ashirian Senate]], in 431 AP, the Empire was formed with [[Leander Ashir]] as the first emperor, consolidated by the [[Phoenix's Bloodright]]. 
### Birth of the Empire
The Ashirian senate was formed with a combination of the Ashir's most trusted allies, trying to include an equal amount of warriors, farmers, academics and other people of the like, the senate electing its first consul, [[Aden Ashir]]. The [[Phoenix's Bloodright]] became the official document justifying the inheritance by blood of the Emperor's role.
### Ashirian Rule
Under Leander's rule, the empire expanded and conquered the entire [[Ashir Valley]] within Leander's lifetime. The senate enacted and wrote its first laws, including the still present [[Ashirian Charter of Rights]] that dictates the natural rights of Ashirian citizens. Ashirian rule lasted for 203 years, from 431 AP to 634 AP where Leander's descendants continued to expand the empire's territory until it covered all of [[Eloran]].
### Phoenixgate
[[Phoenixgate]] marks the change in rule of the senate from being mainly constituted of pro-expansionist members of the Ashirian family and allies of the family to the [[Hudalists]] in the year 634 AP.
### Hudalist Rule
Under the [[Hudalists]], the Ashir Empire went through a period of peace, where the Ashirian Empire consolidated its current territories, and focused on building infrastructure, advancing research and academics and improving international relations. This 200 year streak of peace was interrupted only by the [[One Year War]].
### Vesperian Rule
In the current year of 825 AP, the [[Vesperians]] have overtaken the majority of the senate, marking the second change in senate majorities since its inception. [[Vespera Argent|Vespera]]'s platform rides on the promise of a return to an expansionist, more aggressive Empire in reaction to recent terrorist attacks in [[Avendor]], [[Adenville]], and at the [[Sundown Monastery]], supposedly perpetrated by [[Order of the Black Sun]].

## Politics
---
In the Ashir Empire, there is an Emperor who serves as the head of state and government. However, the Emperor's power is limited by a senate composed of representatives from the various regions of the empire. These representatives are elected by the people of their respective regions, and they meet in the capital city to make decisions on behalf of their constituents. This senate holds the legislative power of the Ashir empire. 

### Emperor
The Emperor is responsible for overseeing the overall governance of the empire and ensuring that the parliament's decisions are executed. The Emperor also has the power to veto parliament's decisions, but the parliament can override the Emperor's veto with a two-thirds majority vote. The emperor also is in title, the head of the military, though often more in form than function. 

The terms for emperors are limitless, and the position is inherited by blood as dictated by the [[Phoenix's Bloodright]]. 

### Consul
The consul, or head of the senate, is voted in by a majority vote of the senate every ten years. Consuls acts as high-ranking officials. They lead government in the emperor's absence or death, oversee administration, and have the power to dissolve the senate and reform it once during their term. The consul is also effectively the ultimate juror, and appoints new members of Sola's court. They are also generally in charge of military operations during war time though this is generally a cooperative process with the emperor and senate. 

## Economy
---
The empire's economy is vast, as the empire itself covers so much territory. That being said, much of its economy is fueled by trade, commerce, agriculture, and technology. Its military might, strategic position and large territories as well as technological advancement makes it a mighty trade partner, controlling much of the international waters on [[Vostera]], trade routes, and a large portion of essential materials like lumber, stone, coal, and now [[Aetherates]]. The empire also sells boats, spell scrolls, militia and protection via the [[Academy Arcanum]] to its allies. 
## Culture
---
The culture in the Ashir empire is varied depending on the regions, and is particularly different in the most recently conquered Imar territories. Nevertheless, some constants in the Ashir zeitgeist remain. There is a culture of strength, civilization, and academics that permeates many facets of Ashirian culture. Ashirians tend to believe themselves as more technologically advanced, educated, and healthier than other political entities on [[Vostera]]. Attitudes towards conquest and war varies, but have recently been seen more positively, partly thanks to [[Vespera Argent]]'s campaign. 
[[The Drain]] has affected the region.
