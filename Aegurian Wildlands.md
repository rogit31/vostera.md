The Aegurian Wildlands are a region south of the continent of [[Aegur]], famous for being almost entirely devoid of humanoids and being extraordinarily hostile to them. The island inhabits a very high concentration of monsters and beasts. 

# Evolutionary Apex 
The Aegurian Wildlands are known to be a particularly intense area of evolutionary development. It is believed that part of the reason why the wildlands have such a high concentration of particularly dangerous predators is because of the progressive evolution of humanoid species outside of the wildlands and the progress of hunting. 

In reality, the main reason why the wildlands are so populated with monsters is because there is an exceedingly large amount of aether on the Island for two reasons: the ocean currents scrape Imari aether-charged liselos from the continent of Imar to the southern shores of the wildlands. There is also a very large amount of Zygonite in the [[Shimmerpeak Alps]], a reflective aetherate that deflected some of the primordial blast, causing a larger portion of Aether to stick to the surface of the wildlands in comparison to the rest of [[Vostera]]. On top of this, the ocean currents and climate of the wildlands is very closely influenced by Imar, and the soil, rain, and thus flora and fauna in the wildlands are aetherically charged. 

This causes: 
- *Rapid evolutionary mechanics*, the flaura and fauna here specialize much faster and much more agressively than on the rest of Vostera
- *Inherent aetheric capabilities*: The flaura and fauna here are much more likely to have inherent capabilities related to aetheric mechanics, including what are effectively spells. Most of the monsters inhabiting the island are effectively capable of casting spells off instinct. 
- *Slight aetheric upcharge*: Spellcasters notice that their spells are slightly more powerful here, though nothing mechanically significant. 

The [[Ashir Empire]] wants to hide this information because: 
- It is heretical to the dogma of the Ashirian Pantheon and the creation myth
- They want to keep the potential of Zygonite, Liselos, and of the wildlands hidden to other governments
- Even further up the chain, to hide the truth of the nature of aether, and of [[The Planewalker]]'s legacy.

## [[Phineas Goldclaw]]

As more of the bookish type, and a spellcaster, Phineas had noticed that there was something afoot in the wildlands. 
# History 
The island has three small humanoid settlements that have been around for about 200 years or so, [[North Point]], [[Cerulean Rise]], and [[Last Respite]]. But the rest of the island is uninhabited and does not feature history from the Planewalker's age. The island has marks of a civilization long past however. 

## Traces of times long past
The island features seven known ruins, each with their individual characteristics and aesthetics. Adventurers and hunters visit these ruins for varying reasons, trying to find treasure or to uncover history long forgotten. 

# Hunting
The island is famous for being the most ecologically rich and dangerous place on [[Vostera]]. As such, a slew of brave hunters come to the island every year to attempt to slay the most dangerous beasts in existence. All three settlements hosts the hunters that have just arrived, as well as farm some of the more minor creatures of the area. They also feature teleportation circles that cost 50 gold per person to transport from Tarisma, Padena, and Nagan, or 10 gold each if you are part of a hunter's guild. 


## Zones
The Aegurian Wildlands are split into four different hunting zones. 

### Blue 
Zone blue, or zone zero is the zone where all of the settlements and about a quarter of the island is. It mostly covers the north coast of the island, and is populated with the easiest creatures to deal with. Most parties that adventure in this zone come back with no casualties.
