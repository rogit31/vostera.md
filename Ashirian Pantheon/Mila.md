## Philosophy

---

While war and love can be seen as opposites, for Mila and her followers this could not be further from the truth, for war is a result of love and passion. In between birth and death, the fate of the mortals already woven in the cosmos by her parents, she gives the threads of fate purpose. The intense love mortals can express and the burning desire to protect loved ones is both the singular reason for existing on Vostera as well as the reason to go to war. When the faithful go to war, they pray to Mila, so that they can give them the strength they need to fight for their loved ones. When the faithful look for their reason to exist in Vostera, they pray to Mila, so that they may have the strength and courage to seek out the passion they desire. And when the war ends, and the battlefield goes silent, the survivors pray to Mila, to give them the compassion and strength to forgive their enemies.

## Symbolism

Mila is represented in art as a tall armored woman with the hair of her grandmother, red fiery crimson. She is often seen holding a waraxe. She is usually represented with her left breast carved from her chest, revealing a constantly bleeding heart, pouring dark crimson blood. It is said that despite her unceasing hemorrhage, the eternal flame lives within her, giving her the courage, vitality and power to move forward and stay on her two feet.
