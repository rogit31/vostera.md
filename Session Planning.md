## Sylril's dream

- Boiling blood pouring out of gaping wound where her right breast should be
- Left parents behind, went to Sola's church, got frustrated and abandoned them. 
- You couldn't handle a bit of bureaucracy, what makes you think you can handle me?
- Last time, I asked you what you are living for. But maybe I asked you the wrong question, for I do not care whether you live or die. What are you willing to bleed for?

# Larger unanswered questions

- What do Vespera and Zeke know about Aylin's history, the old world and the current one?
- Based on what they know, what do they plan to do about it? 
- Who in general knows about the old world? 
- Who knows about Aylin's secret?
- Who knows the academy's actual goals? 

# TODO

- Go into more detail about the Aylin's children's upbringing, I think this will unlock a lot of the story paths for Zeke and Vespera. 
- Finish the playlists, add theme songs for vespera, the order, maybe some others.
- Make some weathered paper and write a letter from Meg's brother magnus
- Buy a better marker and try map-fuing 
- Also, realistically over 800 years what would've the two immortal children have done.
- Rethink the pheonixgate thing. 
- Lucina's statsheet
- Vixal's statsheet
- Complete article about aether
- Green goblin waiting for them at the Last Respite, multicolor armor, metal opening/voice 

# Remember
- Highlight the interactibles (3 things)
- Use music and ambience 
- Embody the character
