- They prepare their ambush
- Fight happens
- They explore the rest of fools gold 
- Or try to save/kill Uuno? lol
## Character arcs
### Hemlock
Vero looooves the exploration and discovery of the pre-titanic world. 
However as the god of madness maybe something goes wrong, or is set as a complication for Hemlock
Maybe give him a wisdom saving throw in combat since it is very reminiscent to his battle days
Don't know what to do with his mother
### Kite
Is obviously meeting her brother in a way
Don't forget to ask directly how she reacts in character
I think the meemaw interactions are great

### Dorbledumb
Could have one of the enemies know him 
What if he experimented on something, it went poorly, and that's why he's so obsessed with experimenting on himself instead
Maybe Vespera or someone else or something else made him forget what and how it went wrong
Which made him obsessed with the idea of remembering who and how he wronged someone or something in his experiments
Which lead him to trying to find a cure to the true modify memory spell
And his obsession with experimenting on himself
Maybe something to do with an old lady since that his other character trait
### Sylril
Has another dream with Mila the night before the fight fo sho
Upside down fiery lake 
Sylril's sister drowns in it
Mila asks him her question again 
### Meg
Literally have no clue besides Magnus
## Empire POV
Vespera knows the tome of civilization is there and in the hands of the dragonrider (most likely her brother)
- She sends academy troops to look for it. 
- They presumably don't know anything else about it. 
- Some academy troops were previously sent to deal with Phineas and his research. 
- They tracked and found the party, had a fight with them, which would have ended in an at least partial academy victory since Phineas's party didn't come back. 
- When they fought, they left behind traces of a fight. Phineas' party fought valiantly, but lost eventually. Uuno interrupts, killing the peacekeepers and kidnapping Phineas' party. He currently inhabits Phineas's body.

# Remember
- Highlight the interactibles (3 things)
- Use music and ambience 
- Embody the character

# When in doubt

## Player ties
- Hemlock's mother
- Meg's brother
- Borse comes back one day
- Sylril and Mila 

## Larger unanswered questions

- What do Vespera and Zeke know about Aylin's history, the old world and the current one?
- Based on what they know, what do they plan to do about it? 
- Who in general knows about the old world? 
- Who knows about Aylin's secret?
- Who knows the academy's actual goals?
