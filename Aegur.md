## Geography
---
Aegur is situated almost entirely on the southern hemishpere, and is a large continent that has a variety of ecosystems and environments. The northern part of the country closest to the equator is covered in a thick jungle, host to an incredible diversity of fauna and flora. The continent is split by the [[Shimmerpeak Alps]], a mountain chain that rises thousands of kilometers tall and is home to many glaciers and mountain peaks.

To the east of the mountain chain, lies a relatively temperate and wet environment, that gets drier and colder the further south you go. To the west of this mountain chain, a rain shadow is cast and features a much drier environment. On this side of the mountains, the environment is desertic near the Giant's Canyon and is akin to a tundra further south. Beyond this, the western side of the Shimmerpeak alps is mostly compromised of dry fields.

To the south of the main continent, features the [[Aegurian Wildlands]], an unexplored island hostile to all that step foot on it, covered in abrupt and barren cliffs and mountainous jagged rocks. The Aegurian wildlands are supposedly home to some of the rarer species on [[Vostera]].

## History
---

Aegur is a land rich in natural resources, including fertile farmland, abundant forests, and vast mineral deposits. The people of Aegur were once united under a powerful monarchy, which ruled over the land for centuries. However, over time, the monarchy became corrupt and the people began to rebel. The resulting civil wars devastated the land, leaving it vulnerable to outside forces. In the early 700s, the Kyrenian Empire began to expand into Aegur, seeking to exploit its resources and establish a foothold in the region. The people of Aegur fought fiercely against the Kyrenian invaders, but were eventually overwhelmed.

Today, Aegur is a divided land, with various warlords and factions vying for control. The people of Aegur continue to suffer under the yoke of foreign oppression, and many dream of a day when their land will be free once more.

## Countries and Regions

---

The continent of Aegur is currently composed of three distinct governmental bodies.

### The [[Aegurian Confederation]]

The jungles from [[Nagan]] to [[Sal'Sol]] compromise the Aegurian Confederation, effectively forming a small country that used to be a group of individual city-states. The Aegurian Confederation is recent, and has strong ties to the Ashirian empire though many are skeptical about how long this alliance may last.

### The Kyrenian North

Much of the northern part of the continent is under the de facto control of the Kyrenian government. Officially, the borders extend from [[Camport]] to [[Nedanas]], with [[Nedanas]] being the largest city of [[Kyrenia]] in Aegur, but there has been Kyrenian military presence of as far south as [[Kelfar]]. It is thought that [[San Bazal]] poses a strong barrier for the expansion of [[Kyrenia]] into Aegurian territory due to it's military might.

### Feudal Aegur

#### Governmental structure

Feudal Aegur is characterized by a decentralized system of governance, where power is dispersed among various lords and local rulers. The land is divided into fiefs, each ruled by a lord or noble, and these rulers owe allegiance to higher-ranking nobility or, in some cases, to the Kyrenian North. The political landscape is fragmented, with individual fiefdoms operating with a degree of autonomy.

#### Military and defense

The military structure in Feudal Aegur is largely feudal in nature. Lords are responsible for raising and maintaining their own forces, including knights, men-at-arms, and possibly conscripted peasants. In times of external threats or conflicts, these individual forces may be mobilized to form a collective defense, but the lack of a centralized military command often leads to coordination challenges.

#### Economy and agriculture

Feudal Aegur's economy is primarily agrarian, with each fiefdom being responsible for its own agricultural production. The fertile farmlands of Aegur contribute to the sustenance of local populations. Trade between fiefdoms and external regions may occur, but it's often subject to the goodwill of local lords

#### Social hierarchy

The social hierarchy in Feudal Aegur is rigid, following traditional feudal structures. At the top are the ruling nobility – lords and ladies – who hold significant land and influence. Below them are the vassals, knights, and peasants, each with defined roles and responsibilities. The rights and privileges of individuals are largely determined by their position within this hierarchy.

#### Cultural diversity

Feudal Aegur is a melting pot of cultures and races, reflecting the diverse demographics of the entire continent. Each fiefdom may have its own unique customs, traditions, and dialects. Many of the fiefdoms in Aegur are led by elves or half-elves, orcs or half-orcs, goliaths or tieflings. The coexistence of various races and ethnicities contributes to a rich tapestry of cultural exchange, although tensions and conflicts may arise due to differences in beliefs and practices.

#### Challenges and struggles

The decentralized nature of Feudal Aegur poses challenges in terms of effective governance and response to external threats. Feuding among lords for territory and resources is common, leading to internal conflicts that hinder collective efforts. The foreign presence of the Kyrenian North adds an additional layer of complexity, with some lords aligning themselves with Kyrenia while others resist foreign rule.

#### Aspirations for independence

Despite the challenges, there are whispers of a desire for independence and unity under a single banner. Many fiefdoms are considering joining the confederation, others are considering allying themselves with the Kyr. Many serfs of these fiefdoms also aspire to become free of the social hierarchy under which they are living, and unrest is common. Whether these aspirations will lead to a unified resistance or further fragmentation remains uncertain.

## Demographics

The demographics of Aegur are varied, but are home to some of the more uncommon races in [[Vostera]].

1. Dragonbron: 17%. At around 15% of Aegur's population, the dragonborn are the most common race in Aegur.
2. Human: 12%. In recent decades, the amount of humans has steadily increased as Aegur welcomes more and more visitors from the Ashirian empire especially.
3. Orc: 11%. The orc community in Aegur is mostly to the west of the continent, but still makes up for a significant amount of the population.

## Economics
---
### Mineral wealth of the shimmerpeak alps

Aegur's economic foundation is deeply rooted in the mineral wealth of the Shimmerpeak Alps. This mountain range is home to valuable minerals and resources, including precious metals, gemstones, and rare ores. The extraction and trade of these resources form the backbone of Aegur's economy on the international scale.

### Confederation's unique economic model

The Aegurian Confederation brings a unique economic model to the region. Unlike the feudal fiefdoms, the confederation emphasizes cooperation and communal ventures in between settlements. Trade, particularly in natural materials, play a vital role in fostering economic ties within the confederation and beyond.

### Trade routes and commerce

Despite political differences, trade routes weave through Aegur, connecting the mineral-rich Shimmerpeak Alps with the lush jungles of the Aegurian Confederation to the west, as well as the different fiefdoms to the east. Major trade hubs, such as Nedanas and Sal'Sol, serve as bustling centers for the exchange of minerals, crafted goods, and unique natural resources, contributing to a vibrant economic landscape.

### Challenges and resource disputes

Economic disparities exist among fiefdoms, with resource-rich regions often enjoying greater prosperity. The potential for conflicts over resource ownership and extraction rights is a constant challenge, leading to diplomatic tensions and occasional clashes. Overall, the fiefdoms closest to the alps tend to have a much more prosperous existence, albeit more violent, compared to those who are purely agricultural, generally further to the west.

## Challenges

---

### Political fragmentation

Aegur's political landscape is marked by fragmentation, with feudal fiefdoms and the Aegurian Confederation pursuing divergent interests. This division hinders unified governance and collaborative efforts, leaving the continent vulnerable to external pressures.

### Kyrenian presence

The expansion of the Kyrenian Empire into Aegur has introduced a foreign presence that adds complexity to the region. Conflicts over territory, resources, and influence create diplomatic tensions and challenge the autonomy of local rulers. The Kyrenian North poses a constant threat to the sovereignty of the region, forcing local lords to navigate a delicate balance between resisting foreign rule and seeking alliances for protection and stability.

### Ashirian pressure on the confederation

The Aegurian Confederation faces external pressures from the Ashirian Empire to keep exploiting the Shimmerpeak alps for export. The confederation's strong ties to the Ashirian empire are met with skepticism, as many believe that this is a show of weakness, though others argue that the empire is a very powerful political ally to have and is key to resisting Kyrenian expansionism.

### Resource disputes

Economic disparities among fiefdoms lead to frequent disputes over resource ownership and extraction rights. Competing interests often result in localized conflicts, further destabilizing the fragile equilibrium within Aegur.

### Environmental threats

Aegur's diverse ecosystems bring both beauty and danger. The Aegurian wildlands to the south pose environmental threats, and the unpredictability of the jungle and mountainous regions presents challenges for both settlers and travelers.

### Cultural tensions

The coexistence of various races and ethnicities within Aegur leads to cultural tensions. Differences in customs, beliefs, and practices sometimes result in internal conflicts, complicating efforts for unity and shared purpose.

### Economic disparities

Disparities in economic prosperity among fiefdoms create social inequalities. The concentration of wealth in resource-rich regions exacerbates power imbalances, contributing to unrest and discontent among the populace.
